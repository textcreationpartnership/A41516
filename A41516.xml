            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Church of God, is in Scripture, under the name of his Love, compared to<note n="(a)" place="margin">Cant. 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>the Lilie among Thorns,</hi> which not only make her uneaſie, but alſo do often ſtrike deep wounds into her ſides: The two head Thorns which from the beginning prickt her ſometimes to the very bowels, and will do ſo to the worlds end, are <hi>Tiranny,</hi> whence ariſeth Perſecutions, and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> the cauſe of great Diſorders and Confuſion, this is the worſt of the two, for tho' the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſtroyeth ſeveral of the members, yet it purges the droſs, and makes the blood of Martyrs the Seed of the Church: But this reacheth the very vitals, lays her in a languiſhing and fainting condition.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Gal. 5, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Tiranny,</hi> is a foraign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, for tho ſometimes perſecutions were raiſed by ſome that had been mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, yet they were fallen off, and had declared open war againſt it: But <hi>Hereſie</hi> rockoned among the works of the fleſh is a Domeſtick Enemy, living within her pales, yet ſo unnatural a child to the Mother, as to divide, rent, and tear her.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt forewarned us, that ſuch things ſhould happen, to the end we ſhould not be ſurprized when they do: Our Bleſſed Saviour fore-told his Diſciples that <hi>there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets,</hi> and to make the Prophecy the more to be taken notice of, he addeth in the next verſe,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Matth. 24.24, 25.</note> 
               <hi>behold I have told you before.</hi> After him St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity for it, and gives the reaſon, for<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.19.</note> 
               <hi>there muſt be alſo hereſies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among you.</hi> And elſewhere he ſaith not of himſelf, but<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1</note> 
               <hi>the ſpirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the latter days ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and doctrines of Devils.</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> gives the like warning how<note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Joh. 4.1.</note> 
               <hi>many falſe prophets are gone out into the world.</hi> There be falſe Prophets that are to come in among the
<pb facs="tcp:41737:3"/>flock <hi>in Sheeps cloathing</hi>
               <note n="(g)" place="margin">Matth 7.15.</note> to do the more miſchief, <hi>but inwardly they are ravening Wolves:</hi> Wherefore 'tis a truth beyond all diſpute, that Men teaching falſe Doctrines are to ariſe out of the boſom of the Church, for as Chriſt's love is compared to the <hi>Lilly,</hi> ſo are the <hi>Daughters</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>Thorns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be tedious and ſuperfluous to name thoſe Plants which our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father having not planted, have been, or ought to be rooted out, and thoſe Tares which the enemy the Devil hath ſowed in the Field; only out of the vaſt number of thoſe that have been notorious, we ſhall mention two <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiarcks,</hi> Authors of abominable Doctrines, one againſt the Perſon of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, the other againſt his Grace. The firſt, <hi>Arrius</hi> who afterwards was followed by <hi>Photinus,</hi> and others, and of late years by <hi>Socinus,</hi> denied and oppoſed the Deity of Chriſt, and in number prevailed to aſtoniſhment, for though that peſtilent Hereſie had, in the days of <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> been condemned at the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, yet afterwards being maintained and upheld by ſome Emperors, in ſome other Councils, as <hi>Sirmienſe</hi> and <hi>Seleucenſe,</hi> eſpecially in that numerous meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Biſhops at <hi>Rimini,</hi> that abominable Hereſie was approved of and confirmed. The other infamous and notorious <hi>Hereſiarch</hi> which oppoſed the Grace of Chriſt to ſet up Nature and Free-will, was <hi>Pelagius,</hi> who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was followed by the <hi>Semipelagians, Papiſts,</hi> and of late by <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians;</hi> and now unhappily at this time, the Church is troubled and peſter'd with both <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and to explode this laſt, the true way is to begin with the firſt, which alſo once was here, and is ſtill a Shooing-horn to draw on Popery.</p>
            <p>Yet herein we ought to admire at, and adore the moſt wiſe Providence of God who thereby not only tryed his Church, but alſo out of thoſe Hereſies brought forth this great Good, that ſeveral truths which before were not ſo well, nor ſo publickly known, and in the dark, have been brought to a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and a more univerſal light; for ever God raiſed ſome eminent Inſtruments to maintain the Truth. Thus <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was raiſed againſt <hi>Arianiſm,</hi> and endued with ſuch courage, and other neceſſary qualifications, that tho' Error ſeemed to triumph in number of Men, yet he ſtood faſt for the Truth; hence it was ſaid of him, <hi>Athanaſius</hi> againſt the whole World, and the whole World againſt <hi>Athanaſius.</hi> If there had never been a <hi>Pelagius,</hi> or ſome ſuch a Man, very likely we would never have had thoſe excellent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which ſo well enlarged upon, and cleared Matters of Grace; ſo that after St. <hi>Paul</hi> the great Apoſtle for free Grace, no Man hath upon thoſe points written better than <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Thus, thoſe Rocks which once others made Shipwrack upon, are to us become Buoys and Warnings.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41737:3"/>
            <p>It hath been, and ſtill is God's Method, from time to time, to exerci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> the Faith of his Church, upon ſeveral and different Matters, by means of heterodox and unſound Men; ſo that though Truth in it ſelf be always Truth, yet ſome may well be called Truths of the Times, becauſe ſometimes they were not at all ſpoken for or againſt, and at one time they were oppoſed more than at another, eſpecially at that very time when old Errors were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, or new ones invented; for afterwards, new things being brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage, old queſtions did wear off, and People minded new ones, yet with this good effect, That after all oppoſitions, Truth appeared the more glorious, like the Sun after it hath diſperſed the Clouds that ſtood between it and our aſpect.</p>
            <p>Thus after the <hi>Roman</hi> blaſt had for a long time almoſt withered the face of the Church, and the Froſts and Snows of the <hi>Alpes</hi> almoſt ſtarved it in appearance, yet when once more the light of the Goſpel began to ſhine, the World was made ſenſible how all fires of Perſecution could not conſume the Truths of God, nor all the Waters of Affliction drown them; that Church which ſeemed to have been buried under the violence and cruelties of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt,</hi> and wholly overlaid with all his Errors in Doctrine, with Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Idolatry in Worſhip, yet when God's time for<note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 9.10.</note> 
               <hi>Reformation</hi> was come, though that light of the Truth appear'd but dim in a little corner of <hi>Germany,</hi> and upon occaſion only of <hi>Indulgences</hi> at firſt, how ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon new inquiries and new diſcoveries, notwithſtanding the rage and craftineſs of thoſe that held it in unrighteouſneſs, did it ſpread abroad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all <hi>Europe</hi> over? So that the Lilly, though amongſt Thorns, by the dew from Heaven, the heat of the Sun of righteouſneſs, and the fatneſs of the Soil watered with the Blood of ſo many thouſands of Martys, became extraordinary fruitful; <hi>Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Sweden, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> the <hi>Low Countries, France, Swiſſerland,</hi> generally, and for the moſt part, and ſome Perſons in <hi>Italy,</hi> received it.</p>
            <p>But ſince, whileſt the Proteſtant Reformed Churches, (though in ſome of their Members lying under Perſecution from Worldly Powers) were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed amongſt themſelves, and agreed upon theſe Points, the Enemy again ſowed Tares, which out of <hi>Flanders</hi> ſpread into <hi>Holland,</hi> whence, not juſt preſently, but ſoon after, that Poyſon crept over hither, where it was oppoſed and condemned, as contrary to the profeſſed Doctrine of the Church as by the Grace of God, I ſhall clearly make it appear.</p>
            <p>Though, upon theſe Matters, ſeveral Books have been written in Defence of Truth, yet 'tis long ſince, ſo that many of them are almoſt out of Print, and thoſe that remain do not fall into every one's hands, wherefore it will
<pb facs="tcp:41737:4"/>not be amiſs ſometimes, and upon occaſion, for ſome to publiſh their thoughts, to aſſert and vindicate Matters of God's Grace and Providence, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what Adverſaries do write or ſay againſt it, in their Diſcourſes, and in the Pulpits, and upon that ſame account I now do bring in my Evidence.</p>
            <p>That which chiefly engages me upon this preſent Deſign, is to hear, upon all occaſions, theſe unſound Doctrines ring out of the Pulpits, which for the moſt part they have been in poſſeſſion of for ſeveral years, they having taken effectual care to keep thoſe that are for the Truth from going up to ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Places; ſo that they would create a belief in People, that what they teach is the Doctrine of the Goſpel received by the Church, and by thoſe means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe into common capacities, thoſe evil Principles which do puff up Men with the Opinion of their Natural Strength, which muſt needs produce dangerous practiſes. We teach, how God from Eternity hath freely Decreed our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, in the fulneſs of time Chriſt purchas'd it, and in time 'tis promiſed and offered us in the Word, and thereby we are called to come in to Chriſt upon his own terms; Sacraments do ſeal it, the Holy Ghoſt applieth it, Faith receives it, and Holineſs, with other good Works, do bear Witneſs to it. In few Words, out of the whole corrupt lump of Mankind, God hath freely choſen ſome to be Objects of his Mercy, and hath elected them to eternal life through Faith in Chriſt our Lord, which Faith, and other neceſſary means to come to Glory, in execution of his Decree, he doth in time give us, till at laſt, through theſe means of Grace, we are brought into eternal life, and all this meerly out of his Mercy, and only through his free Grace; the reſt of Mankind he leaves in their Natural corruption, at laſt to have his Juſtice executed upon them. We attribute our whole Salvation to God's free Grace, and they to Natural Strength and Free-will; which is clearly made out.</p>
            <p>But a further reaſon to engage me upon this Deſign, is the great affinity between <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> for in ſome things they border ſo near one upon the other, and in others are ſo united, that ſpecially they agreeing with Papiſts in moſt of thoſe Points wherein they differ from us, I am afraid of the production of ſome new Monſtrous Opinion, now when <hi>Socinians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, come faſt upon us, and even in Print, without any check, grow bolder every day: God knows what the effect of ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion may prove, and how pernicious to the Souls of many, as ſome of them formerly turned Papiſts, ſo now others may happen to become rank <hi>Socinians.</hi> Once <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> had very near brought in <hi>Popery,</hi> and now 'tis a-pace uſhering in <hi>Socinianiſm;</hi> theſe are great Judgments, though moſt Men ſeem not to be ſenſible thereat, which at laſt may happen to deprive us of the light of the Goſpel; all this danger and evil, if it doth befal us, we do, and ſhall owe to <hi>Arminianiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:41737:4"/>
            <p>Here we have a large Field to bring in the Evidence and Authority of ſeveral of the Ancient Fathers of the Church, engaged in the Defence of the ſame Cauſe with us, which have ſpoken clearly, fully, and to the purpoſe; but becauſe the Rule, I mean the Word of God, is ſo clear, I think it were needleſs to borrow the Authority of Man, which we may believe no farther than it agrees with Scripture, after God hath declared his Holy Will and Mind; neither are there ſuch difficulties, as do need the interpretation of moſt, or many Ancient Doctors: Beſides, it would be tedious for common capacities, which I deſire to make theſe Matters intelligible to, as mach as I can, and the ſubject will admit, to run over ſeveral paſſages of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for 'tis not material, chiefly, for a kind of Readers, to know what <hi>Auſtin, Hilary, Proſper, Fulgentius, Hierom,</hi> and ſo many others, with <hi>Bertram, Bernard,</hi> &amp;c. have written upon the matter, as what the Word of God ſaith about it; wherefore for Proofs, we ſhall ſtick chiefly to <hi>the Law and to the Teſtimony.</hi>

            <p>The Church, like the Ship in the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Marth. 8.24, 25, 26.</note> Goſpel, is toſſed up and down with Winds and Waves, expoſed to Rocks, Sands, and many other Dangers; in ſuch a caſe what's to be done? In Storm time, like the Diſciples, we muſt go to the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> with Cries and Prayers awake him, and ſay, <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh;</hi> for our Comfort we muſt not go far, he is in the Ship, and though he be aſleep, and to make us call the louder ſeems to be ſo, for<note n="(b)" place="margin">Pſal. 121.4.</note>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> A Plea for Free-Grace againſt Free-Will.</head>
               <p>SO much, and by ſeveral hands, hath already been ſaid upon the points I now go about to handle, that I muſt not pretend to bring many new lights to the matter: Only what I propoſe to my ſelf is as much as I can, and the nature of the thing will give me leave, to make it clear to a common Capacity, that ordinary people may not, as often they are, be eaſily impoſed upon by thoſe who diſguiſe and defame the Truth, whither out of Ignorance or Malice or both, let God and their Conſcience be their Judge: all they could, they have done upon wrong ſuggeſtions, to influence a prejudice not only againſt the things but the very names, ſo that ſome are come to that length as to ſlight and leave off reading a Book if they ſee the word <hi>Predeſtination</hi> in it, as if they were frighted with the name, or there was ſome dangerous Poiſon under it: but after this rate, ſuch muſt alſo leave off reading ſome places of Scripture, wherein the word to Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate is ſeveral times contained: I know how to write Truth upon the Mind, and the Heart is the proper work of God's own Spirit; ſpecially thoſe Truths that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and croſs to Man's natural Pride and Inclination: Only I deſire the Reader to remove all prejudices ſo, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and patiently to peruſe thoſe few ſheets, and what God will do for him in the diſcovery of theſe truths
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41737:6"/>which the Adverſaries thereof have done what they could to confine and hide in Corners, and if thereby he meets with ſatisfaction and advantage in the diſcoveries of it, let him thankfully give God the Glory.</p>
               <p>But this is certain, how thoſe errours which tend to deſtroy Grace, and ſet up a ſtrength in Nature, began ſome years ago to be ſo propagated by a ſort of Men who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to meet with, and be reconciled to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they went about (and too far prevailed in't) to corrupt the very Springs of Learning, with keeping out of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> thoſe that were for free Grace againſt free Will, and bringing in only thoſe whom they thought fit for their purpoſe; wherefore 'tis no wonder if ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Streams derived from thence, have been infected with that Corruption infuſed into and influenced upon them, and if the Diſeaſe is become Epidemical amongſt that party, wherein to profeſs ſuch Opinions, was a great qualification for Places and Preferments: But every ſound and Orthodox Chriſtian muſt own, that in matter of Salvation, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not attribute too much to free Grace, nor too little to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and to our own Strength, which is the true State of the Diſpute.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Who <hi>Arminius</hi> was, and what are his Opinions.</head>
               <p>BUT before we proceed, it will be neceſſary for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter information of the Reader, to give ſome account of the Author and of his Opinions. <hi>Arminius</hi> or <hi>James Van Hermin</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> from whom they are called <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> though they take the name of <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> was not properly the Author, but Reviver of old Errors, with ſome kind of alteration. 'Tis commonly known in <hi>Holland</hi> whence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41737:6"/>we have this account of his Perſon, how at firſt (let it be ſpoken without any deſign to reflect) he was a Tapſter or Chamberlain in a Publick-houſe, from whence by the care of ſome Gueſts, who were pleaſed with his Wit, he was ſent to School, and there maintained out of the publick Treaſury of <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> where he afterwards was admitted to be a Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: whence after the Death of Learned <hi>Junius,</hi> he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to <hi>Leyden,</hi> to be Divinity Profeſſor in his place, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition that before his admittance, he ſhould have a Conference with <hi>Gomarus,</hi> &amp;c. and in that Conference he ſhould by an open Declaration of his Opinion, clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of all ſuſpicion of unſoundneſs in Doctrine, and that he ſhould promiſe, if he had any ſingular Opinions, he would not diſcover them to the diſturbance of the Churches: Which Conference was accordingly held before the <hi>Curators</hi> of the Univerſity and the Deputies of the Synod, in which <hi>Arminius</hi> moſt expreſly denyed and condemned the Opinions of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> about Grace, Free-Will, Original Sin, Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Life, and Predeſtination; adding that he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all that <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other Fathers had written againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> promiſing alſo to read nothing different from the received Doctrine: hereupon he was admitted Profeſſor, and for ſome time taught the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches in the points of Chriſt's Satisfaction, Juſtification by Faith, Perſeverance in Faith, Certainty of Salvation, and ſuch other matters as afterwards he denyed; this breach of his promifes was ſo notorious, and he went ſo far on, that to remedy this evil, the calling a Synod was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, which he by means of Friends and Credit which was conſiderable amongſt great Men, as <hi>Barnevelt</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards loſt his Head, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tengobard,</hi> of <hi>Grotius,</hi> &amp;c. he did ſtop it as much as he could, knowing he there ſhould be called to anſwer for himſelf: But ſeeing, how for all his oppoſitions, a Synod was like to be, he fell Sick for Grief, as generally believed, and died <hi>October</hi> 19. 1609. He was ſo full of Envy againſt the reputation of the firſt Reformers, that one of his chief deſigns ever was, how to diſcredit their Perſons and Labours, which ſpirit of his in a high degree is tranſmitted to his Sectators. For certainly no <hi>Papiſt</hi> can or doth expreſs a greater Contempt, Hatred and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41737:7"/>againſt the Bleſſed Memory of thoſe Eminent inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Reformation, than moſt <hi>Arminians</hi> do.</p>
               <p>After his Death, his Party uſed the ſame means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Synod, nay rather than not to do it, they would have betaken themſelves to their Arms, had they not been prevented by the extraordinary care and diligence of <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in Conformity to Orders from the States: Before this, they had ſo ſhuffled things, that with their tricks they hindered it for ſome Years, till the diſeaſe and danger of ruin not only in that Church, but in the State alſo, growing worſe and worſe: And King <hi>James</hi> from hence preſſing ſtrongly the States General for a Convocatio of a Synod, at laſt it began in 1618, to be held at <hi>Dort:</hi> Where did meet Divines, not only within the Dominions of <hi>Holland</hi> and the Seven Provinces, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo out of <hi>England,</hi> and from moſt if not all other Reformed Churches. Tis true the <hi>French</hi> did not ſend in any ſolemn deputation, for they dared not do it without leave of that Popiſh Court, and they choſe rather not to ask than to do it and be denyed; however the ſenſe of that Church was by the French Churches gathered in thoſe Provinces, and then by <hi>Peter Du-Moulin</hi> in his Letters and Book of <hi>Anatomy</hi> of <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> ſufficiently made known to that Synod: and afterwards a <hi>French</hi>

This, the <hi>Arminians</hi> from the beginning thought would be the concluſion of ſuch a Solemn Aſſembly, wherefore like Popes, Papiſts and Hereticks, they were afraid to have things diſcuſſed in a free Council, where the word of God is the only Rule: and therefore they uſed their utmoſt endeavours to ſtop it as long as they could.</p>
               <p>As to <hi>Arminius</hi> his Opinions, they are part from <hi>Pelagius</hi> and part from <hi>Papiſts:</hi> Againſt the firſt God raiſed <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who by force of Scripture did beat the Heretick in all his Errors: yet after his Death,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Fauſtus <hi>and</hi> Caſſianus.</note> thoſe of his Sectators that remained, thinking it not fit for them to own things to the height, as <hi>Pelagius</hi> had done, abated ſomething of it, and made alterations, and got the name of <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> whom alſo <hi>Auſtin</hi> and his Followers did write againſt, with the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41737:7"/>ſame ſucceſs he before had obtained againſt their Founder: In the Eighth Century <hi>Semipelagians</hi> cauſed a great deal of trouble as we ſee in the Cauſe of <hi>Gotteſcalk,</hi> whereof Worthy and Famous Primate <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> hath given ſo true and ſo good an account. About the Year 1590 <hi>Molina</hi> a Jeſuit renewed the old Errors, but was oppoſed at <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Alvarez,</hi> a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nican Fryar, who followed the Principles of <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> hence to this very day continues the diſpute about theſe matters between <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Dominicans: Leſſius</hi> another Je<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſuit at <hi>Lovain</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> became a Second to <hi>Molina,</hi> and under the favour of the Neighbourhood, thoſe Errors paſſed into <hi>Holland,</hi> where <hi>Arminius</hi> entertained them. Let thoſe who have a mind to a fuller account of <hi>Pelagius</hi> his Errors, read what<note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. Ger. hardi Voſſii Hiſt. Pelag.</note> one hath written upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, for I mention it only by the by, and as it leads me to the <hi>Arminians,</hi> who here durſt not appear during King <hi>James</hi>'s Life, but in his Sons Reign under Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi>'s Favour and Protection, in they came with a full Sail, and then indeed, but not before, begins our <hi>Arminian</hi> Church, but with this difference from thoſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> that they incline more to <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and ours more to Popery, hence it is that at laſt ſome of them as <hi>Barret, Montague,</hi> &amp;c. turned Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Now 'tis true, and to be obſerved, how concerning the controverted points we hold the ſame as did the ancient Fathers who did write againſt <hi>Pelagius:</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> aſſert ſome of the ſame things, if not all, which <hi>Pelagius</hi> did, ſo that 'tis the ſame Cauſe, and, as by the grace of God we ſhall ſee anon, <hi>Pelagians</hi> did caſt on their Adverſaries, the ſame aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as <hi>Arminians</hi> do upon us: But firſt we muſt ſet down what are their Opinions contained in ſeveral Articles which they themſelves at the <hi>Hague</hi>-Conference, and at the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> reduced to five the Chief, though there be more: Here I will in ſubſtance ſet them down; but to help the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I muſt firſt write the Orthodox Doctrine in oppoſition to every Article of theirs, as an Antidote and Preſervative againſt the Poyſon. Afterwards I ſhall endeavour out of Scripture to prove it, and ſo confute their Notions, and this as ſhortly as I can, and as far as I am able accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting things with the capacity of the unlearned Reader, which being done, then by the grace of God I ſhall go on, and as

                  </note> there is no abſolute or unrevocable, but only a conditional and mutable Decree of Predeſtination both to Life and Death, and that not of any particular perſons, but indefinitely of all Believers and Unbelievers, and that the number of the Elect and Reprobate is not ſo certain, but that it may be either increaſed or leſſened.</p>
               <p>

                  </note> is the meer good Pleaſure, Love, Free-grace and Mercy of God, not the foreſight of faith, perſeverance, good works, good will, or any other quality whatſoever in the perſons elected: And that though ſin be the only cauſe of Damnation, yet the ſole and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cauſe of non-Election or Reprobation, or why God doth not Elect thoſe that Periſh, is the meer Free-will and Pleaſure of God, not the foreſight of any actual ſin, unbelief or final impenitency in the perſon rejected.</p>

                  </note> is proper and peculiar to the Elect alone, who after they are once truly regenerated and by faith ingrafted in Chriſt, do always and conſtantly perſevere unto the end, though they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fall through infirmity into grievous ſins, yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall totally or finally from the habits, ſeeds and ſtate of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They</hi> ſay that true juſtifying Faith is neither a true ſpecial fruit of Election,<note place="margin">Arm. <hi>IV.</hi>

                  </note> though not in God's intention or his holy Spirit's application, to redeem and ſave all mankind, wherefore he died really and effectually for none but the Elect, for whom alone he actually and effectually hath obtained remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins and everlaſting life.</p>

               <p>Theſe and ſeveral other things of that kind, as namely, the important point of Juſtification, which they ſo highly have corrupted, of Providence and others, which by the grace of God in due time we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of, are the matters we do differ about: yet to what we already ſaid of their adhering to <hi>Pelagians, Maſſilienſes</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians,</hi> we may add how ſome of them own <hi>Socinus</hi>'s and <hi>Worſtius</hi> his Blaſphemies againſt the Trinity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perſons, the ſimplicity of divine Nature it ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as King <hi>James</hi> charges them with it; and well ſo he might, for after <hi>Arminius</hi>'s Death, they were ſo deſirous to be head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Worſtins,</hi> that they uſed all their endeavours to have had him to ſucceed the other in his place of Profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Leyden:</hi> Hence it is that they openly declared they had nothing againſt <hi>Worſtius,</hi> nor had found any thing in his Writings contrary to Truth and Piety, and that it would be moſt profitable for Church and Commonwealth, if his calling ſhould go on. This account we have in the Preface of the Acts of the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> And it is well known how King <hi>James</hi> oppoſed effectually that man's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion to that place, and whoſe Book <hi>De Deo &amp; Attributis</hi> was here burnt by the hand of the Hangman, according to King <hi>James</hi>'s ſpecial Order, and by advice of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Predeſtination.</head>
               <p>SOme ignorant people amongſt Men and Women, are well acquainted with the name, though they do not at all know the thing thereby ſignified; they are ſtartled and abhor the word, as if it was a kind of a Spell, but if they were well acquainted with God's word, they would eaſily find it there. The great Preacher of free-grace, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> hath it no leſs than twice in one and the ſame Chapter,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.5. Verſ. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and ſix verſes lower he adds, <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an inheritance, being predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated according to the purpoſe of him who works all things according to the counſel of his own will.</hi> And in another place, he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it twice in two verſes, <hi>For whom he did fore-know,</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 8.29, 30.</note> 
                  <hi>he alſo did predeſtinate: Moreover, whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it appears it is no Barbarous name, nor unknown to Scripture, 'tis the ſame as fore-ordained and appointed.</p>
               <p>Now I will come to the thing: <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Immutable Decree about the everlaſting future ſtate of Angels and Men: But becauſe we were not concerned in that which relates to Angels, and that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in matter of Predeſtination ſpeaks only of men, we ſhall conſider it only as men are the object thereof: but before, I muſt ſhew what a <hi>Decree</hi> is, becauſe it entereth within our definition; now God's Decrees are the eternal and unchangeable counſels and reſolutions he hath taken from all Eternity, about what he purpoſed to do in time, according to the firſt rule we have laid down: Theſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41737:17"/>Decrees are called God's eſſential works <hi>ad intra,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, according to our capacity and manner of concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, which himſelf in his word is pleaſed to condeſcend to: We then call them Decrees after the manner of Men, for Decrees and Reſolutions of Men are works or acts real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct from Man, from his Underſtanding and his Will: By this way we do conceive God's Decrees or rather God Decreeing, though properly they may not be called his Works, for every act ſo properly called, is an effect real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinct from the Agent: But in God 'tis not ſo, or elſe his ſupream Simplicity would come to nothing; when 'tis ſaid <hi>of God are known all his works,</hi> that knowledge is nothing elſe but his Decree of doing all things to be done in time.</p>

                     <hi>Fulgentius.</hi> Now the Election we here ſpeak of, is not to an Office in which<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Sam. 10 24.</note>

                     <note n="(e)" place="margin">Acts 1.24, 26.</note> was by lot choſen one of the twelve: But 'tis Election to Eternal Life and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now Election is a Predeſtination of ſome Men to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, to be obtained by Faith in Chriſt, only out of God's pleaſure, in them to declare his Divine Mercy: Every part of which definition, we by the grace of God ſhall ſpeak of: This point moſt of any is to be taken notice of,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41737:18"/>becauſe it is the ground of our Hope, Faith, Holineſs, in a word, of the whole myſtery of our Salvation, which doth wholly run and depend upon the decree of our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, therefore to darken it, the Devil hath ſtired up ſo many inſtruments to oppoſe it: In Scripture among many Texts we have, one ſpecially lays open the whole matter before us, which here. I quote to be read with great application.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in heavenly places in Chriſt; according as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy and without blame before him in love: having predeſtinated us unto the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt, to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will: To the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved, in whom we have redemption, through his blood,</hi> &amp;c. The eternity of God's decree of Election is here aſſerted, he hath choſen us in him, before the Foundation of the World; this Election is affirmed to be the cauſe of all ſpiritual bleſſings which God hath bleſſed us with, ſome of thoſe bleſſings are named, as Holineſs, Blameleſſneſs, and Adoption: Now Faith, Repentance, Charity, and ſuch graces are parts of Holineſs, and the fruits of the Spirit, Holineſs is poſteriour to our Election: All thoſe bleſſings are <hi>in</hi> and <hi>by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt: Out of this Text it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo appeareth that the good pleaſure of God is the only impulſive or moving cauſe (if we may uſe ſuch a word which is improper here) to Elect us, nothing from without, all from within according to the good pleaſure of his will.</p>
                  <p>Hence between <hi>Papiſts, Arminians</hi> and Us (for I muſt ſay in matters of grace, they both joyn againſt us) ariſeth the queſtion, What it is that moved God to appoint ſome Men to Eternal Life? We ſay, nothing but God's good will and pleaſure moved him to it. Amongſt ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we have to prove it, I will only bring two of the chief. The <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe Scripture aſſigneth no other cauſe but that as the only, and when the word is ſilent we ought not to ſpeak. The whole <hi>9th.</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:41737:18"/>is a ſentence of condemnation againſt the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; there St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Election,<note n="(†)" place="margin">Rom. 9.16, 15.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not of him that will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy:</hi> Which is but a concluſion out of what God ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the foregoing verſe,<note place="margin">verſe 18.</note> 
                     <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion,</hi> whence he thus concludes, <hi>ſo then it is not of him,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis only of free grace. Why? three verſes after the Apoſtle gives the reaſon, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.</hi> This is very plain, if any one is willing to diſpute God's right herein, let him do't: but he ſhall find God is a ſtrong party.<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath ſaved us and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace, which was given us before the world began:</hi> Here the Decree of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection is made the cauſe of calling, and other graces we receive in time. The other reaſon is, becauſe in thoſe that were elected was nothing at all that could move him to love them.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Epheſ. 2.1.</note> 
                     <hi>We were men dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> unfit for any good thing, and guilty of eternal death.</p>
                  <p>They ſay God hath choſen ſome, becauſe from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he foreſaw they would believe in Chriſt and continue in the Faith; to which ſome add the foreſight of ſome good works with Faith; but againſt this I ſay, God could foreſee in ſinful Man no ſpiritual good, but what out of his mercy he was to give him, (this none but <hi>Pelagians</hi> can deny) conſequently God could not foreſee Faith or Good Works as a motive to his Decree. <hi>God elected us to be holy and without blame before him:</hi> That is, to the end we ſhould be, and not becauſe we were ſuch. Holineſs is an effect, and not a cauſe of Election, Faith alſo is an effect of Election, as clearly expreſſed in Scripture.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Acts 13.48.</note> 
                     <hi>And as many as were ordained to eternal life, believed.</hi> If ſo, then Faith is not the cauſe that moved God to elect us, we were elected to believe, not becauſe we believed before, for then we had choſen Chriſt, and not he us, contrary to what he poſitively ſaith to his diſciples,<note n="(d)" place="margin">John 15.16. chap. 13.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have choſen you,</hi> and <hi>I know whom I have choſen.</hi> Now though Election be the cauſe of Faith, it doth not follow by the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41737:19"/>rule of relatives which are ſaid to be the cauſe of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that Faith ſhould be the cauſe of Election, that max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im is to be underſtood of the natural reſpect and relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Subjects, not of the Subjects themſelves of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, elſe it would a ſo follow, That becauſe the Creator is the cauſe of the Creature, the Creature ought alſo to be the cauſe of the Creator, which is Blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>It is the part of a wiſe Agent, when he doth appoint to the end, alſo to appoint to and provide the means: So the only wiſe God having predeſtinated us to the end eternal life, hath alſo predeſtinated us to the means, namely Faith. For ſaith the Apoſtle,<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.13.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth:</hi> here are the decree, election <hi>choſen,</hi> the efficient cauſe <hi>God</hi> the Object, <hi>you</hi> the end to <hi>ſalvation,</hi> with the means <hi>ſanctification</hi> of the ſpirit, and belief of the Truth or <hi>Faith.</hi> Farther I ſay, if previſion of Faith had been the cauſe of our Election, it would alſo be the cauſe of our Vocation in time, which is contrary to the word,<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> 
                     <hi>God hath called us with his holy calling, not according to our works, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his purpoſe and grace.</hi> I bring one Argument more, which is this, if Faith and Holineſs fore-ſeen, had been the cauſe of our Election, it would follow, that the object of Election had been Man already reſtored through Grace, and juſtified, which is falſe. Take notice that there are not two Decrees, one to Grace, the other to glory, as they ſay, Scripture maketh no mention of a double Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by one and the ſame Decree we are elected to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through Grace, as the means and way; for the firſt in Intention, is laſt in Execution: We are ſaved by Faith, yet not elected by Faith, the reaſon of both being different, Election is an eternal act of God, inward and immediately, proceeding from God, but Salvation is a temporal act of God, outward and mediate, which is perfected thorough many other means, and ſecond cauſes: if the cauſes of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Salvation be the ſame, then the Law of God, the Goſpel, Sacraments and Miniſters, are the cauſes of our Election, for God makes uſe of all theſe means to bring us to eternal life. We are elected <hi>in</hi> Chriſt, not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41737:19"/>
                     <hi>for</hi> Chriſt; God was never moved by the merit of Chriſt to Elect us, but he decreed to ſave us in Chriſt, who is not the cauſe of the Decree, but a <hi>medium</hi> or means appointed in the Election, to execute it.</p>
                  <p>We muſt have a care not to confound between the cauſe and ſign of things which do very much differ; thus the Rainbow is not the cauſe why the world ſhall no more be drowned with a general Flood, 'tis only the ſign of it, the cauſe is God's Will and Promiſe, thus Sacraments are ſigns, not cauſes of the things they repreſent, Circumciſion was the ſign of God's Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> but not the cauſe which was God's Free-grace and Mercy to him; the Lords Supper is the ſign of Chriſt's Paſſion, but not the cauſe, which is God's Free-grace and Mercy to mankind. When our bleſſed Saviour ſaith,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 16.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>When it is evening ye ſay, it will be fair weather for the Sky is red,</hi> &amp;c. that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Sky is not the cauſe, but the ſign of fair or foul weather. Thus to make an Application to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I ſay we muſt take heed not to make Faith the cauſe of our Election, when it is the ſign and effect of it, ſo much poſteriour to it; for Election is from eternity, when Faith is given but in time, and yet ſerveth to prove Election, for whereſoever true ſaving Faith is, there is an infallible ſign, but no cauſe of Election, which far from being cauſed by any grace, is the ſole and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ground of all and every grace we receive, Faith it ſelf the chief Goſpel grace, is an effect of it, as it appears out of many places of Scripture, which I already quoted, ſo out of<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 18.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Acts,</hi> where 'tis ſaid <hi>Apollos helped them much, which had believed through grace:</hi> And thoſe men who will not believe this, will have much cauſe to fear they are of the ſame ſort of thoſe whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeak of, when he ſaith:<note n="(c)" place="margin">John 9.39.</note> 
                     <hi>For judgment I am come into this world, that they which ſee not may ſee, and that they which ſee might be made blind:</hi> There is mercy for the firſt and judgment for the laſt; for certainly Chriſt came into the world both for mercy and for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make ſome unexcuſable.<note n="(d)" place="margin">John 15.22.</note> 
                     <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin, but now they have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:41737:20"/>no cloak for their ſin:</hi> It was ſaid of Chriſt almoſt after his very Birth, That<note n="(a)" place="margin">Luk. 2.34.</note>

                     <hi>a ſtone of ſtumbling, a rock of offence to both the houſes of Iſrael, for a gin and for a ſnare to Jeruſalem:</hi> And Men are too apt to fanſie things to be the cauſe of God's actings, which are not; thus the Diſciples themſelves thought, becauſe a Man was born blind, the Man's ſins or his Parents muſt be the cauſe of it, but our Saviour tells them they were in an error, for<note n="(c)" place="margin">Joh. 9.3.</note> 
                     <hi>neither hath the man ſinned nor his parents, but he</hi> was born blind, <hi>that the works of God ſhould be made manifeſt in him.</hi> This place ſheweth clearly, how God in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he doth, in, upon, or for Men, he minds chiefly his own Glory, and followeth his own will and pleaſure: Thus<note n="(d)" place="margin">Chap. 11.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Sickneſs and Death was for the glory of God and of Chriſt; God denyed the Man his ſight from his Birth, here are his Will, his Power and Juſtice over his Creature, the Lord Jeſus gives him his ſight, there is mercy, thus the works of God are made manifeſt in this Man, and why not ſo too in others, in relation to eternity as well as to time? This Man was naturally blind, but God is pleaſed to give him his ſight; as he might without any wrong have left him in his blindneſs, if it had been his pleaſure: So if God be pleaſed to leave ſome Men naturally dead, in that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and quicken others that were in the ſame ſtate, what hath wretched Man to do to cavil againſt or find fault with it? Or preſumptuouſly not to be ſatisfied with this cauſe, the meer will and pleaſure of God, but muſt prye into his Secrets and forge other Motives, inſtead of ſticking to the Rule and Word of God: To ſuch we may put St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 11.34, 35.</note> 
                     <hi>Who hath known the mind of the Lord; or who hath been his counſellour?</hi> Haſt thou known his mind, or haſt thou been his Counſellour? <hi>Or who hath firſt given to him,</hi> haſt thou? then <hi>it ſhall be recompenſed to thee again.</hi> Thou haſt choſen him to be thy God, before he prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated thee to the adoption of Children, thou haſt believed in him before he elected thee to believe in Chriſt; ſince
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:41737:20"/>thou makeſt God as accomptable to thee, be ſure if he owes any thing, he will pay it, but one ſhould know that<note n="(a)" place="margin">Job 33.13.</note> 
                     <hi>there is no ſtriving againſt God,</hi> and that <hi>he giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not account of any of his matters.</hi> For<note n="(b)" place="margin">Prov. 21 30.</note>

                  <p>As to the queſtion, whether or not the decree of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be abſolute, I ſay 'tis not in ſome reſpect, and in ſome other it is; 'tis not abſolute in relation to the means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the obtaining of Salvation, which are included in the decree whereof the merits of Chriſt and Faith are the chief, though I muſt ſay that the Uſe and Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe means is the work of grace, <hi>God</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi>

                     <hi>performeth the thing that is appointed for me:</hi> And St. <hi>Paul, by the grace of God I am what I am... Yet not I but the grace of God that was with me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And I can do all things through Chriſt, which ſtrengtheneth me. <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.13. It is abſolute in relation to any impulſive or inſtrumental cauſe, or any condition which the decree ſhould depend upon, which is the queſtion between <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> and us: In the execution of the decree, Faith is the inſtrument and hand whereby we receive and apply Chriſt's merits unto us, but it is under no ſuch Notion in the making of the decree. What I ſaid before I repeat here, that there are not two decrees, one for the end, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for the means, but one and the ſame for both, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God willeth together end and means, where one can do, two are ſuperfluous: Now God doth nothing in vain.</p>
                  <p>Let us now ſpeak of the matter of Election, or who are thoſe whom God elected unto eternal life? They are Men fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> and for ſin in the ſight of God, guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eternal death, yet God hath not choſen all men ſinners, but only ſome few of every ſort, eſpecially of thoſe which are low and contemptible in this world: As to the firſt, they are Men fallen in <hi>Adam.</hi> We think this to be the order of God's decrees about Men; <hi>Firſt,</hi> to Create Man for the glory of his Name; <hi>Secondly,</hi> to permit they ſhould fall from the integrity wherein they were created, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come guilty of eternal death. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Out of that whole
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:41737:21"/>loſt lump of mankind, to reſtore ſome to everlaſting life, thereby to ſhew his mercy, and leave the reſt in the ſtate of Perdition and Damnation for their ſins, to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his Juſtice.

                     <hi>elected us that we ſhould be holy and without blame;</hi> Therefore he lookt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as unholy and ſinners. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Scripture call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Election,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 9.15.23.</note> 
                     <hi>a will to ſhew mercy,</hi> and a little lower, the Elect are called <hi>veſſels of mercy;</hi> therefore conſidered as in miſery, for miſery is the Object of Pity and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>We ſay in the ſecond place, all men are not elected, only ſome out of all ſorts, on which Scripture is poſitive,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Matth. 20.16.</note> 
                     <hi>few are choſen:</hi> Neither doth God give eternal life to all, for ſome are Damned, therefore he decreed not to do't; for God doth nothing in time, but what from eternity he decreed to be done, God hath not mercy upon all, but<note n="(d)" place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note> 
                     <hi>he hardneth ſome,</hi> neither doth he give the means of Salvation as calling by the word, Faith in Chriſt, Repentance, Juſtification by Faith, to all but only to ſome, ſo that we may ſay they who are not elected to the means, are not elected to the end, for God will not beſtow the end, but through the means, the very name of Election ſignifieth a choice of ſome out of many, he cannot be ſaid to chuſe, who taketh all promiſcuouſly.</p>

                  <p>To ſay that God hath from Eternity decreed to ſave all and every Man under this condition, if they believe in Chriſt, not only they find in Scripture, nothing to ground it upon, but withall intangle themſelves in two very great difficulties: <hi>Firſt,</hi> to God they attribute a vain and imprudent Decree, for if from Eternity God hath foreſeen that the condition of Faith in Chriſt ſhall not be performed by many, to what purpoſe to make ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Salvation to depend upon ſuch a condition: Such a Decree doth not become the wiſdom of any Man, much leſs of God: The <hi>Second</hi> inconveniency is this, they ſubmit and make faith a free gift of God, to depend upon the free-will of man dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; that it is in the power of Man to believe or not believe, which is meer <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and wholly contrary to Scripture. Theſe conſiderations have ſo wrought upon ſome, that they wave off the fore-ſight of Faith, but betake themſelves to the fore-ſight of the right uſe which Men would make of outward means, of Converſion and Salvation, as the ſerious, ſaving hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reading and meditation of the word of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Sacrament, frequenting of Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But alas, the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, is the fruit of the Spirit, not of corrupt Nature, the ſaving hearing of the Word, as well as Faith, proceedeth from our Election.

                  <p>To this place anſwereth that other about the laſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Matthew</hi> 25.34, &amp;c. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the Kingdom prepared for you, from the foundation of the world.</hi> Here is Chriſt ſitting indeed in his Kingdom of Glory, to Judge the whole World divided into two parts, in execution of the Decree of Predeſtination, ſome ſtanding on the right-hand and others on the left, thoſe Bleſſed, theſe Curſed; here is a call <hi>come ye,</hi> to the Elect, <hi>bleſſed of my Father,</hi> the ſpring of all Bleſſings in Chriſt
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:41737:26"/>Jeſus our Lord; the call is, <hi>to inherit the Kingdom prepared,</hi> and foreordained, a Kingdom that imports honour and glory, joy and power, and an happy eternal life to be enjoyed in the ſight of God, in whoſe preſence is fullneſs of joy, and at whoſe right-hand are pleaſures for ever-more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. All theſe prepared <hi>for you</hi> all, (and none elſe) that are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of my Father, Yea <hi>prepared from the foundation of the world;</hi> here is the certainty of the Decree, here lies his Mercy and Free-grace, that he moſt graciouſly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for us before we had a Being. O what a diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing mercy, whilſt the Curſed are commanded to <hi>depart,</hi> an eternal ſeparation from God, the ſpring of all Joy and Goodneſs, <hi>into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> God hath prepared the Kingdom for the Bleſſed and Elect, and everlaſting fire for the Curſed and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates: Doth not this to the life repreſent Election and Reprobation, whereof God is the efficient cauſe, from Eternity, ſo before the Bleſſed or Curſed had done any Good or Evil to move God? Thus it doth declare the Sentence and Execution thereof.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto, and to the ſame purpoſe may be added, that other Text of Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.32. <hi>Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleaſure to give the Kingdom.</hi> The Elect are here called, little flock, to ſhew the ſmallneſs of the number in compariſon of the Reprobates; Heaven and eternal life are called the Kingdom by way of Excellency, which Kingdom is not any purchaſe of ours, but the gift of God <hi>to give you,</hi> to the Elect, to the little Flock, and to no others upon no other motive, than God's Will and meer Good-pleaſure, <hi>for it is your fathers good-pleaſure:</hi> 'tis not ſaid your God, which is alſo true, but your Father is a more tender word to expreſs love, for in a ſpecial manner he is Father to the Elect, whom God hath choſen and adopted in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, who himſelf is the Author of theſe words, and did ſpeak them upon ſure grounds, and out of his certain knowledge, thus he ſaith elſewhere, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me,</hi> Luke 22 29.

                  <p>But before I conclude this matter of our Election, I muſt ſpeak of the Effects and Conſequences thereof, which are the means whereby to attain unto the end, for as we ſaid before, the moſt wiſe God hath not ordained us to Glory and everlaſting Happineſs, and left us to ſeek how to come there, but alſo he hath appointed the way, that every thing belonging to Salvation, the grounds and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the progreſs and end, may all be of his own, ſo that we may be ſure of it to the praiſe of the riches of his Grace. Hence it is that our Bleſſed Saviour is called not only<note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 2.10. Chap. 5.9.</note> 
                     <hi>the captain of our Salvation,</hi> and <hi>the author of eternal Salvation unto all that obey him;</hi> but alſo <hi>the author and finiſher of our Faith,</hi> which is the way and means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to it. The moſt Holy and Bleſſed Trinity did pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reſolve it. In the execution Chriſt is the Captain and Leader, and he will finiſh it, for he will never give over, till<note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 17.24.11.</note> 
                     <hi>thoſe whom the Father hath given him, his elect be with him where he is, that they may behold his glory:</hi> and <hi>that they may be one as the Father and he are.</hi> Now the means appointed for the execution in time of the Decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, are our Vocation to and in the Church, thorough the miniſtry of the Word, our Converſion, Regeneration, Faith in Chriſt, Juſtification, Sanctification which are all grounded upon our Lord and Mediator Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe means that are between our Election and Glorification, are as the Chain that links it together, and ſpoken of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the place already quoted.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> 
                     <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified; them he alſo glorified.</hi> No danger of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or miſcarrying; it is ſo ſure that he ſpeaketh of it not as a thing to come, but as paſſed and already done. The Conſideration of theſe means, is part of the Decree of Election, as well as Glory and Salvation, for 'tis but one ſingle, and individual act of Election to Glory by the means of Grace, for neither Glory was decreed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to Grace, nor Grace without relation to Glory.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:41737:27"/>
                  <p>Another fruit and effect of our Election is the <hi>certainty</hi> we have of it within us, whereby<note n="(a)" place="margin">This affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Rogers Analyſis.</hi> Pag. <hi>76.</hi>
                     </note> we know and are ſure we are elected to everlaſting life: This certitude ariſeth out of the ſence and feeling we have of the means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to execute Election; every Elect after his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion having faith in Chriſt, may certainly know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be elected: If upon examination of himſelf he may ſay, I by the word of God, am called to the Church and to eternal life, I have the gift of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, that is, I believe my ſins are forgiven me, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Chriſt the Mediator, God and Man. Furthermore with a real and ſincere deſire and endeavour I worſhip God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule of his word, and I love my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; out of this he may conclude, I am elected to life everlaſting: All this depends upon a true examination, and the Conſequence is drawn <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> where are fruits, there is a Tree; when we find heat and motion in a Man, we ſafely conclude there is Life: Now all this examination is grounded upon that Text of <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. which I quoted but a little before, but the calling is inward, proper to Believers that anſwer and obey the call, which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſpeaks of,<note n="(b)" place="margin">John 5.25.</note>

                     <hi>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</hi> Hence we conclude it may be known: This certitude and aſſurance of Election and ſo of Salvation (for if I can but make my Election ſure, then I am ſure of my Salvation) is no motive to ſoftneſs, neglect and careleſſneſs; he who is ſure of Salvation, is ſure to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Condition; Salvation is the end of Election, and Repentance, Faith, Holineſs, perſeverance are the effects thereof, Grace is the way to Glory. God promiſing to ſave the Elect, promiſed alſo to preſerve them in that

                  <p>This certitude of our unchangeable Election doth not, as our Adverſaries would have it, breed in us Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and carnal Security; on the contrary, as we already ſaid, 'tis the greateſt motive and incentive we have to Piety, for which St. <hi>Peter</hi> is my Witneſs,<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.10.</note>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41737:30"/>as I ſaid before, nothing is done in time, but what from eternity God ordered ſhould be ſo: As there is Election, ſo there muſt be a Reprobation, for if all were elected, God would be all Mercy and no Juſtice, and if all were repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, then he would be all Juſtice and no Mercy, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as both theſe Attributes muſt be manifeſted, ſo there ought to be both Elect and Reprobate.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Job 9.12. &amp; chap. 11.10.</note>

                     <hi>Wilt thou alſo diſanul my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayeſt be righteous?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To theſe ſeveral Texts, I ſhall add only one reaſon, which is this. If God had predeſtinated no Man to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, either no body is damned, which is contrary to Scripture, as I ſhewed already; or elſe if any be damned
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41737:30"/>'tis by chance, or elſe out of an extemporal or ſudden change in the will of God, all which are abſurd and falſe: Though God be merciful in the higheſt degree, it doth not hinder its being perfectly juſt: He doth not uſe his mercy towards all, but only thoſe on whom he will have mercy, by his Juſtice he doth reprobate and harden men for their ſins; neither is this contrary to the goodneſs of God, for that perfection whereby he doth good to ſome, doth not hinder his Juſtice and Judgment againſt others: Neither doth it follow that becauſe 'tis the duty of one Man to wiſh ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Man well, therefore God is bound (for this is the objection) to wiſh and do good to all; God and Men are not bound by the ſame rule, a Man is bound to wiſh his neighbour well, in as much as he knoweth it not to be contrary but according to the word of God; but not withſtanding any Law, God willeth all things for himſelf, therefore he willeth evil to the wicked for himſelf, that is for the glory of his Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Sin is the reaſon for Reprobation, if we abſolutely inquire into the cauſe, for Man fallen and ſinner is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated: But if comparatively there is no other cauſe but the pleaſure of God. Hence ariſe two queſtions. The <hi>firſt</hi> why from eternity God hath decreed to damn ſome Men? The anſwer is, God hath ſo decreed for ſin, which in his ſight they were guilty of; and this to declare his Juſtice; nevertheleſs, ſin alone is not the cauſe of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the will of God doth intervene, without which no Man ſhould be reprobate for ſin, for notwithſtanding ſin, God without doing his juſtice wrong, could have decreed Salvation to all, for by means of his Son he could fully have ſatisfied his juſtice. This as to the firſt queſtion. The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, why God hath decreed for ſin to damn theſe or ſuch and ſuch Men, rather than others? no other cauſe can be aſſigned, but the good-will and pleaſure of God. Sin can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the cauſe, for all Men conſidered in themſelves, are all equally ſinners, the following example will illuſtrate the thing. Let there be many guilty Men convicted of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, the Prince commands ſome to ſuffer, and others he gives a pardon to, if the queſtion be put, why out of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41737:31"/>many, only ſome are puniſhed? The reaſon is good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Rebels, for the Prince being juſt, he puts none to Death without a juſt cauſe; but if again the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion be put, why out of many theſe rather than thoſe do ſuffer, Rebellion cannot be ſaid to be the cauſe, for they all are equally guilty. Some Schoolemen in matters of Reprobation do diſtinguiſh between the negative act, called Preterition, or paſſing by, or the will not to give eternal life; and the poſitive or affirmative, or the will of damning. The <hi>firſt</hi> ſay they is Abſolute. The <hi>ſecond</hi> not ſo, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to ſin, as a neceſſary antecedent. But every act may in a different reſpect be called Abſolute and not Abſolute, if the queſtion be made Abſolute or Comparative.</p>
                  <p>The Matter or Object of Reprobation are they whoſe names are not written in the Book of life of the Lamb,<note place="margin">Rev. 13.8.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they be the greateſt part of ſinful Men in the ſight of God, conſidered as fallen and corrupted with ſin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are called<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 9.22.</note>

                     <hi>few are choſen,</hi> which doth exclude the reſt, therefore Reprobates are more in number, and greater is the number of thoſe that are damned, than of thoſe that be ſaved.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Matth. 7.13, 14.</note> Some ſay againſt this, a juſt Judge doth Decree equal things for thoſe that are equal, wherefore ſince God is a juſt Judge, having elected ſome ſinners, he hath not reprobated others, which are not worſe; but this rule is meant only of a Judge, who by Law is bound equally to diſtribute rewards and pains, but if there be no ſuch obligation, without acting contrary to juſtice, he is free to make an unequal diſtribution to thoſe that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is argued if the number of Reprobates be greater than of the Elect, then the juſtice of God will be greater than his mercy, which ſeemeth to be contrary to that place of Scripture,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Pſal. 145.9.</note>

                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:41737:31"/>The anſwer is, the Mercy and Juſtice of God are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either in themſelves, and as they are in God, or in relation to their Effects and Objects; upon the firſt account they are equal, upon the laſt it may be ſaid that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Mercy of God upon all men is greater than his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but in relation to his ſpecial Mercy about Salvation, 'tis leſſer, or of a leſs extent than his Juſtice.</p>
                  <p>The end of Reprobation is that the Juſtice of God may be made known in the puniſhment of ſin, according to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>

                     <hi>according to his purpoſe,</hi> as may be ſeen in ſeveral places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>As to the Immutability of Reprobation, 'tis proved out of God's Unchangeableneſs, for as he is Unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo are all his Decrees.<note n="(c)" place="margin">Iſai. 46.10.</note> 
                     <hi>My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all pleaſure.</hi> If it be thus, will ſome ſay, then 'tis in vain for Reprobates to repent, for they cannot change their doom, yet Scripture promiſeth forgiveneſs of ſins to penitent ſinners. I anſwer, in reprobates there is no ſuch thing as true Repentance, as we ſee in the caſe of <hi>Judas,</hi> who repented, not<note n="(d)" place="margin">2 Cor. 7.9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>of that repentance to ſalvation, not to

Yet if reprobates could truly and ſincerely repent, they would not be damned; hereupon our Adverſaries lay at a catch, and will ſay, then the Decree of Reprobation is changeable and can be reverſed; but not ſo, becauſe reprobates neither do nor can truly repent, but ſaith one, they are commanded to repent; 'tis true, but this Precept ſhews their duty, what they ought, not what they can do. Frecepts and Threatnings do ſometimes make reprobates to abſtain from ſome certain ſins, and though they cannot avoid eternal death, yet they have this advantage, that their condition<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 11.24.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall be more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> than of thoſe that give themſelves to all manner of wickedneſs, for as there are degrees of guilt, ſo there will be of pains; beſides, that this abſtaining from ſome certain ſins, or having an outward ſhew of repentance of them, puts off for a time thoſe judgments which they are afraid of, as befell wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> who ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs, for that heavy judgment which the Prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> by God's ſpecial command threatned him with and his houſe, upon his outward ſhew of repentance,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Kings 21. from 17. to. 29.</note> was put off till his Sons days.</p>
                  <p>Of Reprobation there are two Effects and Conſequences. <hi>Firſt,</hi> A deſertion, or God's totally forſaking them. The <hi>Second,</hi> Induration or hardning; the firſt is a final denial of Grace neceſſary to obtain eternal life; thus God is ſaid to forſake wicked Men, when he leaves them in unbelief, and denyeth them Faith in Chriſt, which no reprobate hath. <hi>Hardning</hi> is a higher degree of puniſhment, 'tis an effect of God's anger when he doth not take away the hardneſs and malice which is in a Man's heart; but by a juſt judgment, it becomes a puniſhment for former ſins, and by outward means is ſo aggravated, that though God addeth no new degree of hardneſs, it ſuffereth it to ſpring out of the root of former evils; thus we often read in <hi>Exodus,</hi>
                     <note n="(c)" place="margin">Exod. 4.21. and chap. 7, 3, 13. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>God hardned Pharaoh's heart,</hi> and the<note n="(d)" place="margin">Chap. 14.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but this hardning doth not indifferently befall every reprobate,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41737:32"/>only ſome notorious ſinners; whence it is a particular judgment of God, which is not executed with a bare Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Direction, with relation to every reprobate, but with acting ſomething within and without the wicked, whereby their malice and hardneſs is increaſed, we have ſeveral reaſons to prove it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Hardning is a Judiciary act of God and an effect of his Anger. Now a Judge doth puniſh not only with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting and directing, but alſo with actually inflicting a Pain by himſelf or by another. When God hardneth, he doth ſomething as it appeareth by the uſual phraſe of Scripture, which expreſſeth the judgment of an Angry God, with words ſignifying an action; now he who only permitteth, doth not act, but leaves others to act, and to call this a direction to the end, is not to the purpoſe, the direction is not the hardning, but a conſequence of it; Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore, if hardning properly ſo called was a bare permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it would not be a ſpecial judgment of God as it is, againſt notorious ſinners, becauſe no ſin is committed by any ſinner whatſoever but by God's permiſſion. Moreover, if God was ſaid to harden Men, becauſe he permitteth them to be hardned, in the ſame manner he might be ſaid to Kill, Steal, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe he permitteth all theſe ſins, which is moſt falſe: Therefore God's hardning a Man's heart is not a bare permiſſion but an action, as it appeareth in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for if God had hardned only permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, there had been no need of ſo often repeating by <hi>Moſes</hi> the command of letting the people go, no need of ſo many Miracles wrought, nor of ſo many Plagues infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted upon <hi>Egypt,</hi> whereby the Tyrant was more and more hardned and more cruel: Which is the effect of thoſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God upon ſome, to whom they are an occaſion of growing worſe and worſe: Thus when<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rev. 16.9, 21.</note>

                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> taught out of Scripture, and by other ſtrong reaſons proveth how God doth blind the minds and hardneth the hearts, not with <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but with power and action.</hi> Amongſt other things in ſeveral places he ſaith to this purpoſe, how by a juſt and ſecret judgment of God, the wills of wicked Men are moved to commit thoſe things which in relation to Men have the nature of ſin. This I bring to ſhew that as our Adverſaries would have it, 'tis no new Doctrine of our own, but that ſome Eminent Doctors of the primitive Church have found it in Scripture as well as we.</p>
                  <p>But the better to underſtand this, we muſt know how God hardneth, <hi>Satan</hi> hardneth, and <hi>reprobates</hi> harden themſelves: God as a Judge, Satan as an Executioner, and the wicked harden themſelves as guilty Men. <hi>Firſt,</hi> God hardneth, not by infuſing any malice or hardneſs, but <hi>firſt</hi> leaving them in their hardneſs, not ſoftning them, withdrawing and denying them his Grace. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Working ſomething both within and without wicked Men, by means whereof out of their natural corruption, they take an occaſion of hardning themſelves more and more, ſuch are ſeveral <hi>thoughts and affections,</hi> not evil in themſelves as may be outward luſt and deſire of Honour, Riches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the corrupt mind is eaſily and blindly inticed by and lead unto ſuch are alſo ſeveral Calamities, Precepts, Accuſations, Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, Prohibitions. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> With delivering up to <hi>Satan</hi> and to ones corrupt affection. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Inclining evil affections to ſome certain Objects as a puniſhment, for ſome times one ſin is the puniſhment of another. The <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> having God's leave hardneth with inticing men to all ſorts of evils, blinding Reaſon, diſturbing the Fancy, ſtriking Fear, giving vain hopes, and ſuggeſting evil Thoughts, when Men are either awake or a ſleep: <hi>Wicked
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41737:33"/>men</hi> do harden themſelves with giving up themſelves to their own luſts, rejecting the dictates of Right reaſon, deſpiſing commands, threatnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence it appeareth how the acts of the Devil and of Reprobates ſide, concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to harden, are evil for the moſt part, but on God's part all are good of themſelves; therefore God can by no means be made the Author of ſin, though he hardneth not only with permitting, but alſo in acting: There is no certainty of Reprobation whilſt Man is alive, except in caſe of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt which is never forgiven, and ſo committed by none but Reprobates, all other ſins are pardonable which are common to Elect (ſpecially to thoſe not yet regenerated) and to Reprobates, therefore by them we ought not and cannot ground any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: The ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt doth not befall eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reprobate, but only ſome, as induration properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and although the number of Reprobates be much greater than that of the Elect, yet no Man but he who is guilty of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hath juſt cauſe to deſpair, and of that too, one is not raſhly to judge; but hereafter we ſhall have occaſion to enlarge upon this.</p>
                  <p>Before I make an end with this point, as much condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to our purpoſe, and to ſhew that what we hold in this matter, is the doctrine of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I muſt ſhew how two Objections of our Adverſaries againſt it, were ſet down and anſwered by the Apoſtle. They are contained in the <hi>9th Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> wherein are decided theſe matters of Election and Reprobation, now in queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians</hi> or <hi>Arminians.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> objection is as if God was unjuſt in his abſolute Decree of Predeſtination. The queſtion is ſet down verſe the 14. in theſe words: <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is there unrighteouſneſs with God?</hi> The anſwer is in the ſame verſe, <hi>God forbid.</hi>
                     <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 9.14.</note> The ground of the queſtion is in verſes, 11.12, 13.

What? ſaith car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal reaſon, to make ſo great a difference where is ſuch an equality, to love and to hate thoſe which had not deſerved it, cannot be without ſome injuſtice: yet, ye ſee the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, no ſuch thing, <hi>God forbid,</hi> for the Lord is juſt in all his ways, and the reaſon of this by the Apoſtle given in the following verſe, is this, the will of God, <hi>I will have mercy one whom I will have mercy.</hi> Out of this we ſay, the purpoſe of God according to Election, is here underſtood of God's eternal Predeſtination, which Election is aſcribed only to God who calleth, all works excluded, becauſe there were none, nor could be none, the perſons not yet being born.

Herein we are not to preſume beyond what is written.</p>
                  <p>For all this they make two Objections, <hi>firſt,</hi> 'tis againſt the Juſtice of God to reprobate Men who have done no evil, though Scripture ſaith clearly it is ſo, to father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice upon God, is certainly a great impity, God is moſt juſt in every thing he doth, though we cannot fathom into the particular cauſes, yet his juſtice is a general one, the conſideration whereof ought to ſtop the mouth of every Creature. What ſhall we ſay to the caſe of the Flood, which was a great judgment, whereby the whole World, eight perſons excepted, periſhed in the Waters. 'Tis true, the wickedneſs of Men was raiſed to an utmoſt degree, but withall it muſt be owned, that there were many Infants, new born Babes, yea ſeveral quick in the Womb who had committed no actual ſins, yet were involved in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41737:35"/>deſtruction. <hi>Death,</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul reigned from Adam to Moſes, even over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of Adam's tranſgreſſion Adam</hi>'s ſin was an actual ſin, eating the fruit of the Forbiden-tree, it could not be Original, for he was created in Innocency; but ſeeing<note n="(a)" place="margin">Chap. 6.23.</note> 
                     <hi>death is the wages of ſin,</hi> and that thoſe Infants who had committed no actual ſin, dyed in the Flood, we muſt find another ſin, not after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, and that is Original-ſin. Now I ſay, that as Original-ſin was a juſt cauſe of the natural Death of thoſe Babes, ſo the ſame ſin, when it pleaſes God to leave them in it, is a juſt cauſe of Eternal Death, in thoſe whom he puniſheth with it; for Eternal Death, as well as Natural, is the wages of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, as of Actual-ſin. And though ſin be not the cauſe to move to paſs ſentence upon any, yet that ſentence is paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon none but what are ſinners. Hence I conclude, that as God was juſt in inflicting by the Flood, Natural Death upon thoſe Children that were unborn, or newly born, before they had done any evil, ſo this holds for Election as for Reprobation, in relation to Faith as to Unbelief, according to that famous place of <hi>Romans,</hi> about <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau.</hi> It is to be obſerved how St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls<note n="(b)" place="margin">Pet. 2.5.</note> 
                     <hi>the world of the ungodly,</hi> that world which the Flood drowned, without any exception at all of Infants or others. What hath been ſaid of the Flood, may be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the ſame purpoſe of that terrible judgment upon <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorah,</hi> and the Cities about them, where no doubt were alſo Infants, new born Babes and ſome quick in the Womb, which as<note n="(c)" place="margin">Jud. 7.</note> St. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſuffered the vengeance of eternal fire, and are ſet forth for an example.</hi> Yet in all thoſe things no exception againſt God's juſtice, for he is moſt juſt in all his ways. For if we muſt believe <hi>David,</hi> the Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.17. What ſhall we ſay as to the caſe of <hi>Achan,</hi> his ſin was perſonal, he alone had committed it: yet that ſame ſin his Sons and Daughters; nay the very Beaſts, as his Oxen, Aſſes, Sheep as well as he, were by God's immediate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſtonned to death, and burned with fire: Though, in the eyes of Men, they ſeemed innocent, yet were guilty in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41737:36"/>the Lords eyes. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.24, 25. So in the particular caſe I before quoted, of the Man that was blind from his birth, our Saviour ſaith, that neither the Man had ſinned nor his Parents, but that the works of God ſhould be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in him, This was a ſufficient anſwer to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, they put no more queſtions about it. But <hi>Arminians</hi> will impeach God's juſtice for denying ſight to one who had not actually ſinned. Do not they do ſo in calling the equity of God's Decrees touching Men into queſtion? Can any thing in Scripture be plainer than this,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 9.18, 22, 23. Epheſ. 1.11.</note> that God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth, that he hath appointed ſome to be veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of mercy to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, and ſome to be veſſels of wrath, to make his power to be known, and that he maketh all things after the counſel of his own will<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>: Yet what more uſual than to diſpute how this can agree with juſtice? And with what reaſon God may puniſh that ſin, which by vertue of a Decree is unavoidable. 'Tis ſtrange, yet too true, how peremptory ſawcy and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſpeeches ſome in their Cups, and others ſometimes upon other occaſions break into, upon this ſubject, and would reduce God to ſuch terms of reaſon as they fancied to themſelves. After ſuch declarations about theſe things which God hath given in his word, were it not better to give him Glory, and with <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>O Lord, thou art juſt when thou ſpeakeſt, and pure when thou judgeſt:</hi> And if they cannot conceive how this ſhould ſtand with equity, rather than to call to queſtion God's juſtice, were it not better to own their weakneſs. And with <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>this is my infirmity.</hi> For wo unto him that ſtriveth with his Maker, according to <hi>Solomon,</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Objection they make, and which we already have given a hint to, is this, if I be reprobate, and 'tis God's pleaſure I ſhould go to Hell, it is not in my power to help it, ſo their Damnation they father upon God's pleaſure: This is too much like our firſt Parents, to lay the fault upon others, to excuſe themſelves,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.12.13.</note> 
                     <hi>The woman whom thou giveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the tree, and I did eat:</hi> He throws it on the Woman, and ſhe upon the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, <hi>the ſerpent begiuiled me.</hi> If God had not given him the Woman, then he would not have ſinned, nor the Woman, if God had not created a Serpent; ſo if God had not reprobated us, ſay ſome, we had not been damned. But this is no more able to excuſe them, then the fig-leaves were to cover their nakedneſs, though never ſo cunningly ſewed together.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle lays open the caſe, how God directeth and turneth all for his glory, even the worſt of things, For <hi>our unrighteouſneſs doth commend the righteouſneſs of God, and thorough our lie the truth of God hath more abounded unto his glory.</hi> Rom. 3.5, 6, 7. Yet for all this, though theſe evil things are turned to the greateſt good, that is, the glory of God, we are nevertheleſs guilty and not excuſeable when God judgeth us as ſinners, and <hi>takes vengeance of our unrighteouſneſs.</hi> The Doctrine then is this, that the ſins of Men ſerve to the glory of God, for as skillful Phyſicians make poiſons to be ingredients into their beſt Cordials, ſo the wiſe God makes Man's greateſt ſins to be ſubſervient unto his glory, and draweth good out of evil. Yet for that, thoſe poiſons are poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in themſelves, thoſe ſins in themſelves are ſins, and God doth puniſh them without any injury either to his mercy or to his juſtice. But becauſe 'tis natural: with Man to raiſe queſtions, to find out excuſe for himſelf, here the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth propoſe one, which carnal ſence and reaſon, are apt to make againſt this Doctrine, and therefore to quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the objection, and ſhew he doth not approve of it, he ſaith, <hi>I ſpeak as a man:</hi> Well, what doth Man ſay, if my ſin commends the righteouſneſs of God, and becomes an inſtrument of his glory, then God is unrighteouſs to take vengeance of me, and puniſh me as a ſinner, beſides, that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41737:37"/>I cannot avoyd ſinning, being a reprobate. But the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>God forbid,</hi> though things be ſo, yet there is no unrighteouſneſs in God, thou art in the wrong to think and to ſay ſo, and he gives a reaſon, <hi>For then, how ſhall God judge the world?</hi> and as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid, <hi>Shall not the judge of all the earth do right? Gen.</hi> 14.15. This is a true Doctrine which by ſome was miſconſtrued, and that makes St. <hi>Paul</hi> complain, they <hi>ſlanderouſly reported of him:</hi> We have the ſame ground to complain againſt <hi>Arminians,</hi> and for the like ſlander: Let this Text be compared with that of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.14.15.</p>
                  <p>To what hath been ſaid, we ſhall add that the Decree of reprobation is the ſentence, and Damnation the execution of it. Sin is not the cauſe of reprobation, but ſin is the cauſe of Damnation; God as Judge hath paſſed ſentence, yet there is a reprieve, but the laſt day ſhall be Execution-day, then actual ſins ſhall be laid to the charge of repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, they ſhall have nothing to ſay for themſelves, why ſentence ſhould not be pronounced againſt them. For the ſins of the Elect, they ſhall ſolemnly be declared to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given in and through the Lord Jeſus; and though Grace be the means appointed for us to come to glory, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates are not appointed to ſin, though it be the way to eternal miſery, for there is a different reaſon of means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Salvation and thoſe to Damnation. God is the Author of the firſt, which are good, becauſe he puts into the Elect that which was not in them, namely, his Grace, Faith, Repentance, Holineſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as to the laſt, he infuſeth nothing into reprobates, he finds in them that which is evil, namely ſin, and there he leaves it, he is not bound to take it away, Mercy is free, and God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Grace, which is the way to Salvation, but not of ſin, which is the way to Damnation: Theſe two ſeveral ways all the world will go, ſome one way, and ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, wherefore that Exhortation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Cor. 13.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Examine your ſelves, whither you be in the Faith: prove your ſelves: know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except you be reprobates.</hi> The reaſons of God's election and reprobation differ as much as Mercy doth from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41737:37"/>from Juſtice: His ordaining means for one doth not conclude his ordaining means in like manner for the other.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the Text about <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> which ſtrikes home upon them, they ſay two things, <hi>firſt,</hi> concerning the ſignification of the word <hi>hated. Secondly,</hi> That tis ſpoken of temporal advantages, and not of ſpiritual things. As to the firſt, God loved <hi>Jacob,</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau,</hi> mean's nothing elſe but that God loved <hi>Eſau</hi> leſs than <hi>Jacob,</hi> which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation they ground upon that place, where 'tis ſaid that <hi>Leah</hi> was <hi>hated,</hi> that is, as in the foregoing verſe, leſs loved than <hi>Rachel,</hi> Gen. 29.31.</p>
                  <p>We know how in Holy Scripture, one and the ſame word, hath ſometimes a different ſignification, but the true one, is always to be deduced out of the ſcope of the place, and the Analogy of Faith. How often doth the word of God mention his Hatred, Anger, Indignation and Wrath againſt the wicked, whom he is ſaid to abhor, and they are ſaid to be abomination unto the Lord, when God ſpeaks of evil men, in oppoſition to the good, whom he is ſaid to love as to hate the others, muſt we underſtand that hatred, of his love only with this difference of a leſſer and lower degree, this were to overthrow the whole Scripture, and the intent of God's Spirit therein. Certainly the ſence of that Scripture by them quoted, doth not at all reach our caſe, or come within our preſent purpoſe. There it is ſpoken of the paſſion of a Husband who having two Wives, that Affection of his had two ſeveral Objects; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth the love and hatred of God towards his Creatures, which in <hi>verſe</hi> 18. of the ſame Chap. is repreſented by his ſhewing mercy to one and hardning the other. Let the ſignification of a word be what it will, yet all muſt agree how there ought to be a vaſt difference in the meaning, in relation to the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of a Husband towards two Wives, whereof he loves one more than the other, and that of God, of a great and a juſt Judge towards two perſons whereof he hath choſen the one and rejected the other, as may be ſeen in the caſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul:</hi> As in that of <hi>Abel,</hi> unto whom and to his Offering the Lord <hi>had reſpect,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 45 5.</note> and of <hi>Cain</hi> unto whom and to his Offering <hi>God had no reſpect.</hi> The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41737:38"/>like may be ſaid of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that was the Son of the Promiſe, and <hi>Iſhmael</hi> of the Fleſh, and ſo here God loved <hi>Iſaac</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, love and hatred are humane Paſſions, not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in God, though improperly attributed unto him after our manner of conceiving, and to condeſcend to the weakneſs of our Nature, they are not affections in, but effects from God; when God beſtowes favours, he is ſaid to love, and when he inflicteth puniſhments, to hate. By love and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God are meant the Mercies or <hi>Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>Curſes</hi> of God, <hi>Come ye bleſſed, depart ye curſed.</hi> 'Tis called the wrath of God, which abideth on him that is the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever. Reprobation is called hatred,<note place="margin">John 3.36.</note> as Election love. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.11.</p>
                  <p>Now we muſt come to the other part of their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how here the Apoſtle ſpeaks of temporal advantages, and not of ſpiritual bleſſings: To ſay that love and hatred here relate only to temporal things is not enough, thoſe words are taken out of <hi>Malachy,</hi> 1.2, 3, 4. and there is in it alſo ſomething of the worldly concernment, when God ſaid he laid his Mountains, and his Heritage waſt, for the Dragons of the Wilderneſs, which yet is a Metaphorical expreſſion, whereby things of another nature may be repreſented as we ſee at the latter end of the <hi>4th.</hi> verſe, 'tis called <hi>the border of wickedneſs, and the people againſt whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</hi> So this hatred is extended upon his Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>But as to the ſcope of the place, we can neither deſire nor have a better interpreter than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 9. Where we find he doth apply it to ſpiritual things; not only to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mercies and Judgments, but alſo to eternal, as 'tis the whole ſcope of the Chap. Wherein from the beginning the Apoſtle ſheweth God's diſtinguiſhing mercy in matters of Religion between <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to the firſt, beloved, the Adoption, and the Glory and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law and the Service of God and the Promiſes, which our Saviour reduceth to Salvation, when he ſaith <hi>Salvation is of the Jews.</hi> John 4.22. All which privileges, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were excluded from, as the Apoſtle ſaith elſewhere
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:41737:38"/>
                     <hi>they were without Chriſt, being aliens from the common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the Covenants of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi>

He goes farther, for he declareth diſtinguiſhing mercies between the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when he ſaith, <hi>They are not all Iſrael that are of Iſrael.</hi> And what alſo meaneth his oppoſition, <hi>of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the fleſh, to the children of God, of the promiſe,</hi> and <hi>of the ſeed?</hi> Doth he not make a palpable diſtinction and viſible oppoſition between <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>In Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> which afterwards doth continue in the perſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>Eſau</hi> had Temporal Bleſſings, his Father gave him the Fatneſs of the Earth and the dew of Heaven from above; he grew Strong and Mighty, ſo the great difference between him and <hi>Jacob,</hi> conſiſted not in worldly advantages, it was of another nature; in Scripture he is branded with the name of prophane, who after he had ſold his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; yet before his Father, called himſelf his firſt Born, and would as ſuch have inherited the Bleſſing, which though his Father intended for him as we ſee by his being ſo cautious to know when <hi>Jacob</hi> came for it, whether or not he was <hi>Eſau</hi> indeed, yet thorough Gods providence and <hi>Rebeckah</hi>'s direction, he was deprived of, and as Scripture ſaith, <hi>when he would have inherited the bleſſing, he was rejected.</hi> Gen. 27. Heb. 12.16, 17.</p>
                  <p>Part of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s bleſſing to <hi>Jacob</hi> was this, <hi>Bleſſed be he that bleſſeth thee, and curſed be every one that curſeth thee;</hi> which curſe lighted upon <hi>Eſau,</hi> who afterwards <hi>hated Jacob,</hi>

Here take notice how the ſeveral Reſtrictions and Applications of the promiſe, not only about the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which was to be but one individual perſon; but as to the reſt of the Seed of the promiſe, the birth-right which otherwiſe was a great privilege, was of no advantage, nor nothing elſe of natural conſideration, but ever God himſelf made the difference, contrary to the opinion, and ſometimes to the inclination of Parents, as we ſhall ſhew it in its place. We ſee God's diſcriminating choice in the almoſt conſtant preference he gave the younger Brothers, ſo that the birth-right, as we ſaid juſt now, was of no advantage to elder Brothers, and this by St. <hi>Paul</hi> is hinted at, when he quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that place of <hi>Geneſis, The elder ſhall ſerve the younger.</hi> In few words, that whole method of God in bringing by degrees things into that Line, out of which the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was to come, is wonderful, and doth confound all humane Reaſoning and Speculation, God managing every thing ſo, that nothing of humane Wiſdom, Choice or Power appeared in it, if it was thus in the execution of that part of God's eternal Decree, much more cauſe have we to ſay there was nothing of Man's Prerogative, Good Diſpoſition, or any thing elſe of that kind in the framing of the Decree, when as yet no Creature was exiſting, wherefore God's Predeſtination ought to be wholly and only attributed to his Good-will and Pleaſure. When that great Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> was abroad anointing one of <hi>Jeſſe</hi>'s Sons to be King, which was an Election only to an Office, how much was he miſtaken in his judgment? As<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Sam. 16.7.</note> God himſelf ſaid to him in words very conſiderable, how much more ſhall they be miſtaken, who in matter of relecting Men to Eternal Happineſs, do fancy other motives, beſides the Good-will and Pleaſure of God.</p>

                  <hi>As for you, ye thought evil againſt me, but God meant it unto good, to bring to paſs as it is at this day, to ſave much people alive.</hi> For thus they were preſerved from being deſtroyed by Famine, and this in order for above 400 years after, to bring them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> with ſo many wonders, and to lead them into the poſſeſſion of the promiſed Land. But before I leave this point, ſome thing more I muſt offer to the conſideration of ſerious and thinking men. Certainly the ſeveral degrees of God's Providence in <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s caſe, are to be admired. Firſt, his dreams, then his declaring of them, which raiſed the hatred and envy of his brethren againſt him: his Fathers ſending him to them in the field, whereupon they took counſel to kill him: <hi>Reuben</hi>'s preventing their deſign, and adviſing to caſt him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Pit, God at that very time bringing by a company of <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malites,</hi> and <hi>Juda</hi>'s council of ſelling him to them, their bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him into <hi>Egypt</hi> and ſelling him unto <hi>Potipher</hi> a great Man with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> his Wifes unchaſt deſigns upon him, her manner of vengeance ſeeing her ſelf denyed: And here indeed appears a dark effect of a wiſe Providence, that ſo good an act of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:41737:43"/>his ſhould be followed with his being caſt into Priſon; but 'twas in order to bring him nearer to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> for 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved how the Lord was with him, giving him favour in the ſight of the keeper of the Priſon, as before he had fonnd grace in the ſight of <hi>Potipher</hi> whilſt he was in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, God's Providence brought into the ſame place the <hi>Butler</hi> and the <hi>Baker</hi> of the King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then followed their ſeveral dreams with their interpretation by <hi>Joſeph,</hi> whoſe deſire the chief Butler minded not, but forgat him. But two years after <hi>Pharaoh</hi> dreamed, and none of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians could interpret, upon this occaſion the Butler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered him, ſo he was ſent for by the King, and after the interpretation he was raiſed to be next under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the greateſt Man in the Kingdom. Then God called for a Famine upon the Land; but as <hi>David</hi> obſerveth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105. he had ſent a Man before them to preſerve life to <hi>Jacobs</hi> Family, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his brethren, <hi>it was not you that ſent me hither, but God. Gen.</hi> 45. In <hi>Egypt</hi> they multip ied exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, though under Oppreſſion and Bondage, till the time of their deliverance, as promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was come, and the iniquity of the <hi>Amorite</hi> was full: How much is herein to be admired God's wiſe and adorable Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? Thus (for a <hi>ſecond</hi> inſtance) the combination of<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 4.27.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Herod, Pilate, the Gentiles and people of Iſrael,</hi> againſt our Saviour, to ſhed innocent blood, was by God's Providence directed, <hi>to do whatſoever the hand and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God determined before to be done.</hi> We muſt think the like of every other effect of Providence, though we cannot tell the reaſons of it. I declare in the whole diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in time of our Salvation, nothing moves me more than the conſideration of God's ordering things for the good of his people, and I therein admire and adore his Infinite Mercy, Wiſdom and Power.</p>
               <p>And thus God over-rules the evil deſigns of wicked men, and of devils too, for although their being evil be contrary to God's will, which is good, it doth not hinder but that they do fall under his Providence, for as a ſtubborn Horſe is by the Rider governed and directed to a certain end and place; and as a Magiſtrate doth rule and compel to duty, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Rebellious Subjects; Thus with the Curb of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41737:43"/>God doth over-rule the ſtubbornneſs of the wills of Devils and Wicked Men, reduceth them to order, and directeth them to his end. We ſee in the caſe of <hi>Job</hi> how <hi>Satan</hi> can do nothing againſt him, without God's ſpecial leave, neither can he go a jot beyond what he is allowed. Againſt this truth this objection is made, God is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of things done by his Providence, but God is not the Author of Evil and Sin, therefore Evil and Sin are not done by his Providence. I Anſwer God is the Author of things efficiently (that is the true and proper effect of a Cauſe) done by his Providence, but ſin and evil are not effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently done, but permiſſively, or by permiſſion, as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ſhall be explained. Evils of ſin, are ſaid to be done by Providence, becauſe God ruleth things done by evil and wicked Men, yet is free from the evil and ſinfulneſs thereof, Thus a Rider ruleth and maketh a lame Horſe to go, yet is not the cauſe of the lameneſs, a Man writeth a good hand, yet writting with a bad Pen, what he writes is not well written, 'tis not the fault of the Hand but of the Pen; the lameneſs lies in the Horſe, and the vitioſity of fault in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument.</p>
               <p>Now Providence is a Divine and perpetual act, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all and every thing is preſerved, ruled and directed to its own and proper end: There are three degrees of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as <hi>Preſervation, Governing</hi> and <hi>Ordering</hi> of all things; out of every one of theſe degrees do appear the Wiſdom, Freedom, Power and Goodneſs of God: Hence he is ſaid to adminiſter every thing <hi>Wiſely,</hi> becauſe<note n="(a)" place="margin">Hob. 4.13.</note> 
                  <hi>every thing lies open before his eyes;</hi> all being well diſpoſed towards good and certain ends, Cauſes do accordingly produce their effects. God herein acteth <hi>freely,</hi> for nothing compelleth him to this Government of the World, neither doth he without himſelf act any thing out of a natural neceſſity, but out of his own free-will, then <hi>powerfully,</hi> becauſe out of his own Will and Pleaſure he doth what he pleaſeth without any trouble or diſturbance, ſo that nothing can hinder him. Laſtly, he adminiſtereth <hi>well,</hi> becauſe he never fails in any thing he doth, out of any miſtake or error in the underſtanding, or a deviation in his Will from that which is Right, Good and True.</p>
               <p>And though I am to ſpeak chiefly of God's ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:41737:44"/>yet before I enter upon the matter, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the better underſtanding of it, for me to go up higher and ſay ſome things in general of the acting princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in God, which is threefold, <hi>Directing, Commanding</hi> and <hi>Executing;</hi> the principle directing the Action, is the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which in God is the ſame with his Divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Wiſdom; This is a property of God, whereby he knoweth himſelf, in himſelf, and every thing without himſelf, not only of things that are, whether they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, contingent, paſſed or future, whether thought, ſpoken or done, whether good or evil, but even thoſe which are not to be, and all that moſt truly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly: This underſtanding is the principle directing the Action, for no intelligent Agent willeth and executeth any thing but what the Intellect hath ſome fore-knowledge of, and propoſed it to the Will. In Men are the Intellect a faculty of the Soul, Science an habit of that faculty, and Knowledge an act proceeding from the faculty, thorough the habit, but no ſuch diſtinction in God, in whom all theſe are but one and the ſame, diſtinguiſhed only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our manner of conceiving, God by his Eſſence, and not by any faculty or habit doth underſtand all in one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal indiviſible and unchangeable Act, becauſe every other manner of knowing, is attended with imperfection; for he is a moſt ſimple and infinite Agent, in him no Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, no Firſt and Laſt, in him is the moſt perfect power of underſtanding, the knowledge of God being nothing elſe but the nature of God knowing, with one Act he comprehends his whole nature, and all things beſides, as the Sun at once giveth light to every thing that is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to receive it, much more the eye of God infinitely brighter and more piercing than the Sun, doth ſee and know all things that can be known and are viſible, which univerſal Science is by Scripture attributed unto God.<note n="(a)" place="margin">John 21.17.</note>

                  <hi>all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</hi> God's Science of <hi>ſimple intelligence,</hi> or of things that can be, or of <hi>viſion,</hi> of things that ſhall be, we wholly omit, but the conditional Science call'd <hi>media,</hi> becauſe a middle between the other two, was forged by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and is an abſurd invention of theirs, to reconcile free-will and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41737:44"/>with the infallibility of God's <hi>Preſcience</hi> and Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. One thing more to be obſerved upon this is, that the will of God is in order before his Science of things to come, wherefore God hath foreſeen this or that ſhall come to paſs, becauſe from Eternity he decreed to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Therefore the will of God is the <hi>commanding principle,</hi> as his mind the directing. Theſe are (if I may ſo ſay) the grounds which his Providence is acted by, this will is that whereby God willeth himſelf, by himſelf, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing out of him for himſelf; that is for his glory, in Scripture this Will is attributed to God.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iſai. 46.10.</note>

               <p>To dive into theſe matters, and be able to underſtand the works of learned Divines upon the Subject, one muſt well obſerve ſome diſtinctions of the will of God, as <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>revealed,</hi> of the <hi>good-pleaſure</hi> and <hi>of the ſign.</hi> The <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> properly ſo called, is the eternal and unchangeable Decree of God, about doing or permitting ſeveral things in time to be done, which for want of being revealed are unknown to us, of this 'tis ſaid<note n="(e)" place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Secret things belong to God,</hi> as of the other, <hi>But thoſe things that are reuealed belong to us and our Children.</hi> Thus there are many things relating to particular men, which except thoſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the certitude of Faith, we are wholly ignorant of. Wherefore St. <hi>James</hi> reproveth the pride and over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of thoſe, who for time to come diſpoſe of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,<note place="margin">Jam. 4.13, 14, 15.</note> though they know not what that day or next will produce, therefore he will have them to add this, <hi>If the Lord be willing.</hi> The <hi>revealed</hi> will is not properly the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, but a declaration made in the word, which ever is an evidence of ſome Decree, but not always of that which we took it to be; this declaration is made either by way of Precept, Promiſe or Threatning, if that be done which God commandeth to be done, that declaration of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41737:45"/>God's will, is a ſign and evidence that there was a Decree of doing or permitting the things that are done, if what is promiſed be performed, that declaration ſignifieth there is a Decree of performing what is performed, ſo if God inflicteth what is threatned, the revelation is a ſign of a Decree, to have things inflicted which are inflicted. But if that which is commanded to be done be not done, that declaration is ſign of a Decree to admoniſh a Man of his duty by way of Precept, and oblige him to do it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to make him unexcuſable. And if what God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth under an expreſſed or implyed condition, be not per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ormed, the declaration is ſign of a Decree of ſhewing a Man reaſon why he may obtain a good promiſe? And why that promiſe is not obtained, namely, the neglect of the condition preſcribed, and if that which is threatned be not inflicted, the declaration is ſign of a Decree to exhort and invite a Man to his Duty and Repentance, and of remitting the puniſhment upon condition of Repentance; whence it appeareth that there is no contradiction between the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and the Divine Decree, if one conſidereth well the diverſity of Decrees, and the meaning of the Revelation.</p>
               <p>The other diſtinction of the <hi>good-pleaſure,</hi> and of the <hi>ſign</hi> doth not differ from the former, only that the good-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is a Decree properly ſo called, which may be either ſecret or revealed; for ſome are ſo, the will of the ſign, is the ſame with the revelation of the Decree, but one muſt have a care not to miſapply a declaration to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which 'tis not the declaration of and doth differ from, which ſome do, and ſo run into difficulties and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies. Now our aſſertion is, that God will have nothing with his <hi>good-pleaſure,</hi> but what alſo he will have with the <hi>ſign,</hi> provided one doth not underſtand every good pleaſure, as for inſtance, God in his word would have all men to be holy and obedient to his Law, but ſeeing the moſt part of the world is not holy and obedient, we draw this conſequence, that God by his eternal Decree, will not make all men holy, and ſo will not have them to be holy, for none is holy, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he is made ſuch by God. Here ſeemeth to be a contradiction between the Good-pleaſure and a ſign, which if ſo, what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the truth of word of God; wherefore though there be ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, yet there is no contrariety, for the will of God revealed in the word, or the declaration that will have all Men to be holy, is not the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41737:45"/>ſign of the Good-pleaſure or Decree, nor to ſanctifie the greateſt part of Men, for here is no agreement between the ſign and the thing ſignified, or between the Word and the Decree, but 'tis the ſign of another Decree, namely, to invite and command Men to do their duty, and ſtudy Holineſs: As to the other Decree of not making holy the greateſt part of the world, it hath another declaration, partly in the words and partly in the event. There is then no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, but that ſign which doth not agree with that Decree which it doth not belong to, will agree with another of which it is the ſign.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this is a matter of high concernment, both as to the Decrees of God, and as to his word between which, nor in the word it ſelf, there is no contrariety, to make the matter the more clear, I will bring two more inſtances; The <hi>firſt</hi> is out of <hi>Geneſis</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gen. 22.2, 12.</note> God ſaid to <hi>Abraham, take thine only ſon Iſaac whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Moriah, and offer him there for a burnt offering,</hi> &amp;c. Here God commandeth <hi>Abraham</hi> to Sacrifice his Son, but in the 12 verſe, <hi>lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him.</hi> Here God forbiddeth him to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his Son; hence it apeareth as alſo the event made it good, how God would not have <hi>Iſaac</hi> to be ſacrificed, though before, he had poſitively commanded it. The <hi>ſecond inſtance,</hi> God by <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Exod. 9.1, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Let my people go, that they may ſerve me,</hi> theſe are the words whereby God declareth he will have <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, and verſe the 12. <hi>God hardned the heart of Pharaoh that he would not let the people go.</hi> As<note n="(c)" place="margin">Exod. 4.21.</note> he ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> he would do. <hi>I will harden the heart of Pharaoh that he will not let my people go.</hi> Which God did at<note n="(d)" place="margin">Chap. 10.20, 27.</note> ſeveral times, hence it appeareth that God in his Decree would not have <hi>Pharaoh</hi> at that time to let his people go, when he commanded him to let him go, for God hardened his heart that he would not let him go. This is the other inſtance.</p>
               <p>God forbid that Scripture ſhould attribute to God two contrary wills, a ſign contrary to the Decree, or a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in his word oppoſite to his eternal purpoſe, which to affirm is no leſs than Blaſphemy. What difference or
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:41737:46"/>contrariety ſeems to be here, is not real, only in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, ariſing from this, that though in Scripture, God ever ſignifieth, that he will have that which indeed he is willing to have, yet he doth not always preciſely ſignifie, that poſitively he would have that which at the firſt ſight we conceive him to be willing to have: Wherefore to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move difficulties, to aſſert God's truth and ſhew the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and agreement between God's Good-pleaſure or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and his revealed will in his word, we muſt go to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and accordingly proceed to a farther examination of the places.</p>
               <p>In the Hiſtory of ſacrificing <hi>Iſaac,</hi> do appear two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and different thoughts of God, partly out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and partly out of the Event: The firſt was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Iſaac</hi> on whom were the promiſes, and hinder <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> from killing him. The ſecond thought of God was his will, by a command to engage <hi>Abraham</hi> to Sacrifice his Son, (who by vertue of that order, prepared himſelf to obey) and thereby give an illuſtrious example of Obedience, which was tryed by this. For in the firſt verſe 'tis ſaid, <hi>God tempted Abraham,</hi> ſo was <hi>Job</hi> tryed to be made a famous example of Patience, as in this, <hi>Abraham</hi> was both of Faith and Obedience. Now to the point, to every one of theſe Thoughts and Decrees of God, anſwered its ſign, which are not to be confounded one with another. To the firſt, and not to the laſt belonged this Sign, or Declaration, <hi>thou ſhalt not lay thy hand on the Lad,</hi> &amp;c. which at firſt was not revealed to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Not to the firſt but to the laſt anſwered this ſign, <hi>Offer thy Son for a burnt offering,</hi> ye ſee here is no real contradiction; different Decrees, different Signs, and a true harmony between ſigns and things ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, which would be diſturbed, if the ſign of the firſt was attributed to the laſt, and of the laſt to the firſt.</p>
               <p>Now to the other Inſtance, in the Hiſtory of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> are alſo to be conſidered two different Thoughts of Good-pleaſure of God. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the firſt, ſecond and third time commanded to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go, God's will was not ſo ſoon to bring his people out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but to harden the heart of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not to let them go. The ſecond Thought
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:41737:46"/>was to oblige <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by a ſpecial command to let the <hi>Jews</hi> go, but not preſently, for then God had miſſed his aim, and with hardning <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s heart had contributed towards it, which is in no wiſe conſiſting with God's Wiſdom; but the end was to let <hi>Pharaoh</hi> underſtand that he was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed for obſtinately diſobeying God's command, and this hardneſs of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was an occaſion for God <hi>to make his power known through the earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 9.16.</note> Every one of theſe thoughts had its proper ſign, the firſt's and not the laſt's (which at firſt was hidden from <hi>Pharaoh</hi>) is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>I will harden the heart of Pharaoh that he will not let my people go.</hi> The ſign of the laſt and not of the firſt declared to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>let my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple go.</hi> Thus one may ſee here is no real contradiction, but a true agreement between the ſigns and the decrees, as their things ſignified, and it would cauſe a confuſion if they were not rightly applyed. Thus one may ſee the true ſenſe and meaning of thoſe places of Scripture, which I have the more inſiſted upon, becauſe the matter is of ſo high a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and that by the means of thoſe diſtinctions of the will of God, one may reſolve the doubts and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which occur upon this matter.</p>
               <p>But before I leave it, I muſt take notice of a new fangled diſtinction already mentioned in the Chapter of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the more becauſe this brings us directly upon <hi>Arminians,</hi> 'tis of the will of God unto <hi>abſolute</hi> or peremptory, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,</hi> the former ſay they depends upon no conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the laſt doth. If by this they meant only that which is called of the ſign, it might be allowed, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Scripture are conditional Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings. But when they extend it to God's Decrees, ſome whereof they would have to depend upon certain conditions, which from Eternity God hath foreſeen ſhall never be performed, as when they ſay, <hi>God hath decreed to ſave thoſe that are to be damned, upon condition they ſhall repent and believe in Chriſt.</hi> We cannot but reject it as contrary to God's Wiſdom. Amongſt Men one would be lookt upon as very imprudent and inconſiderate, who would ſeriouſly reſolve upon a thing under a condition, which he is moſt ſure,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:41737:47"/>will never be performed. Thus if a Prince would in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt reſolve to make an old ignorant Man, unexperienced, dull, unskilfull in every Art and Science, his Chancelour, upon condition he becomes a famous Orator, a great States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, very Wiſe and Prudent, verſed in all manner of learning, and that he gets all endowments neceſſary for the Place (which compariſon I look upon as very defectuous to repreſent what I mean) what would one ſay of ſuch a Prince? And what can we ſay to thoſe who would father ſuch inconſiderable and nonſenſical decrees upon <hi>the only wiſe God.</hi> Which of theſe two is more conſiſting with the Word and Wiſdom of God? To ſay, <hi>I elect ſuch a one to Salvation, if he repent and believe,</hi> or, I <hi>elect him to Salvation through Faith and Repentance, which I will give him,</hi> taking theſe means for condition they enter into the decree, thus when God decreed to ſave <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family, it was by the means of the Ark: As I ſaid before, <hi>'tis the part of a wiſe man when he appointeth to the end to appoint alſo to the means,</hi> theſe means enter into God's decree, for by them as away, he will bring men to his end; now theſe conditions do not hinder the decree from being abſolute, that is, it doth not depe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d upon a condition, for God hath abſolutely decreed to ſave a Man by Faith.</p>
               <p>Of the ſame ſtamp is their other diſtinction of God's will into <hi>antecedent</hi> and <hi>conſequent,</hi> which they explain thus, God hath decreed indifferently to ſave all and every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Man upon condition, if they believe in Chriſt, and this by an antecedent <hi>will:</hi> again he hath decreed to ſave on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome, becauſe he hath foreſeen only ſome few would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and this is done by a conſequent <hi>will.</hi> The firſt is contrary to the wiſdom of God. The ſecond alſo argueth God of Imprudence, and with <hi>Pelagius</hi> ſuppoſeth faith in Chriſt to depend upon the will of Men, contrary to what Scripture affirmeth poſitively.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ephſ. 2.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Faith is the gift of God,</hi> and why to make two decrees of one, when one can and doth ſerve. That Truth which out of Scriptures we do aſſert, doth ſtand altogether and all in good order, when the erroneous opinions of our adverſaries are in confuſion, and by pieces and do not well agree together.</p>

               <p>To anſwer their Objections we are to know that to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry decree belongs it's ſign, which is conditional, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree not ſo, as any ways to depend upon the condition, and though the <hi>will</hi> of the ſign be conditional, and that of the decree abſolute: Yet the agreement between the decree and the word doth remain, for according to the rule of <hi>Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> and <hi>Logicians,</hi> every propoſition whereunto is annexed an unpoſſible condition to which anſwereth one, which for certain can never be performed, is equivalent to an abſolute or Catagorical Negative, this agreeth with an abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative decree, not depending upon the condition. Thus the promiſe of Salvation to one (who by reaſon of his final impenitency is to be damned) under condition of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and faith in Chriſt, is equivalent to a Catagori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Negative of Salvation for that Man by reaſon of his final Impenitency. To this anſwereth the negative decree, with relation to Impenitency and Unbelief, as cauſe of future Damnation; for all this, God doth not mock thoſe whom he promiſeth Salvation unto under condition, though he hath not abſolutely decreed to ſave them, for by this conditional promiſe God ſhews them the means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the juſt cauſes of Damnation, namely, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of thoſe means which go before Salvation, and he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to the end they be unexcuſeable, and make them ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible how juſtly they are damned. But ſay the adverſaries, they cannot apply thoſe means, true, but this excuſeth them not, for 'tis thorough their fault they cannot. Some put a queſtion whether there be any Cauſe to the Will of God, not as to the Object of the Will without himſelf relatively to the Creature, tis generally granted he hath, but the queſtion is about the will wherewith God willeth: Divines anſwer no Cauſe <hi>per ſe</hi> of it ſelf properly called can be given of the Will of God, either inſtrumental, impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive or final, becauſe God is ſo Cauſe-active, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Cauſed or Paſſive, his Will is Independent, and there is nothing greater, nor before the Will of God, in whom is not a <hi>Will</hi> of the end, and another of the means, for as with one ſingle act he knoweth the cauſe and the effects, ſo with one ſingle act he willeth the end and the means. They who attribute moving and impulſive cauſes
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41737:48"/>to the Will of God, do it to condeſcend to Man's capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for men cannot repreſent to themſelves the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Majeſty of God, but in low and humane concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Now we ſhould come to the executing principle, or the third part of the principle of acting in God, and this is his <hi>Power,</hi> but becauſe it leadeth us to Providence, which is our preſent Matter and chief Subject, we omit ſpeaking to that as not conducing to our preſent purpoſe, and reaſſume our Diſcourſe about Providence, where we left it.</p>
               <p>There are three parts or degrees of God's Providence. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Preſervation. <hi>Second,</hi> Governing. <hi>Third,</hi> Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As to the firſt, God's preſerving Providence is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended over all his Works, 'tis a continued Creation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he preſerves all his Creatures; ſome as to their <hi>Species,</hi> others as to their <hi>Individuums.</hi> Under the firſt Branch come all things Mortal and Incorruptible. Under the ſecond thoſe that are Incorruptible, but this I omit inſiſting upon, to come to that which is to my purpoſe; namely, that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Providence of God in the preſervation of his Elect in this world, from thoſe great and imminent dangers that are brought upon them, whereof Scripture affordeth ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances, as of<note n="(a)" place="margin">Gen. 7.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family from the Flood, by the means of the Ark;<note n="(b)" place="margin">Gen. 19.15, 16.</note> of <hi>Lot</hi> from the deſtruction of <hi>Sodom;</hi> of<note n="(c)" place="margin">Exod. 2.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.</note>

                  <hi>Elijah,</hi> for God commanded the Ravens to feed him, and at <hi>Zarephath</hi> alſo provided for him; of <hi>Shedrach, Meſhack</hi> and <hi>Abedne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> the three young Men that were delivered from the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fiery Furnace; and <hi>Daniel</hi> from the mouth of the Lyons. But becauſe there is no diſpute about this part of God's Providence, I come to the next, which is the governing part.</p>
               <p>The Government of the World is an act whereby God by his Supream Authority, Power and Wiſdom, ruleth all things, and diſpoſeth thereof according to his Will, and this is done either <hi>actively</hi> or <hi>permiſſively:</hi> By the firſt God doth act every good thing, either <hi>immediately</hi> or <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,</hi> 'tis in the firſt manner when God makes uſe of no
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:41737:48"/>Inſtrument or Second Cauſes, to ſhew he is not tyed to them, thus he immediately created the world without any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When God worketh with Second Cauſes, and Inſtruments he is ſaid to act <hi>mediately</hi> and by means, and this not out of any neceſſity, for he can do all he pleaſeth without them, but 'tis only out of his Free-will and Pleaſure, not for want of Power, but out of a fullneſs of his goodneſs, to communicate to the Creatures a power of acting, and alſo to teach us how to make uſe of the ordinary means by him appointed. Theſe Inſtruments which God maketh uſe of, are either good or bad, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or extraordinary. Good Inſtruments he maketh uſe of when by the means of good and pious Miniſters, he calleth Men to Salvation; when he ruleth People by good Kings, and preſerveth Believers by good Angels: God alſo maketh uſe of bad Inſtruments. Firſt to puniſh the wicked, when by the means of the Devil or wicked Men he deſtroyeth Tyrants, Witches, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> Secondly, He chaſtiſes his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when he ſometimes delivereth them into the hands of Cruel Tyrants, to the end that being thus afflicted, they may know their ſins, repent and draw near to God. Thirdly, To try the Faith and Patience of his Children; thus he makes <hi>Job</hi>'s Patience known all the world over; he made uſe of the Devil and of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> and <hi>Sabeans:</hi> And although thoſe evil Inſtruments which God maketh uſeth of, do ſin, yet God doth nothing amiſs, he doth not infuſe any malice into them, but maketh a good uſe of that which in them is inherent, to execute his juſt Judgments. <hi>In the ſame work,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auſtin, God is juſt, and Man guilty, becauſe in the ſame thing they have done, they had different ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ordinary Inſtruments, which God maketh uſe of, are Second Cauſes appointed to produce certain ends, thus the Sun is the uſual means whereby God doth give light to the World, heat and warm the Earth, for to that ſame end it is appointed, and always made uſe of, the word of God is the uſual means to convert Men to God. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary means are thoſe which are not appointed always or for the moſt part, to cauſe ſuch effects, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41737:49"/>to God's Will, they variouſly produce ſometimes one thing ſometimes another; thus God to kill a Man doth ſometimes make uſe of a Thunder-bolt; another of the fall of a Houſe; of a Wild Beaſt; of Highway-men. Hence one may ſee there are an ordinary and an extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: The firſt is when he obſerveth the order he at firſt ſettled in Nature, namely, that certain Cauſes acting according to the perpetual Law of Nature, ſhall produce ſome effects which hold a proportion with the ſtrength of the Cauſe: Hence are the ſeveral ſeaſons of the year ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding one to another, riſing and ſetting of the Planets, motion of the Stars; and the generation and corruption of worldly things. The extraordinary is when God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or beſides the way and order ſettled in Nature above the ſtrength of Second Cauſes, doth through his Omnipotency provide for things. Hence are Miracles which are Works of Divine Almightineſs, exceeding the power of Second Cauſes. Hence it is that thoſe Second Cauſes ſometimes employed by God in working Miracles, in relation to the miraculous effects, are ſigns and Evidences rather than Cauſes. When God hath a work to do, and hath a mind to make uſe of Inſtruments he doth fit them for his purpoſe.<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Chron. 20.6.</note> 
                  <hi>For in his hand there is ſuch a power and might, ſo that none or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is able to withſtand him.</hi> Becauſe<note n="(b)" place="margin">Prov. 21.30.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor underſtanding, nor counſel againſt the Lord.</hi> In point of theſe acts of God's Providence, let it be farther obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how though God hath appointed certain Cauſes to produce ſome effects, yet as he is not tyed to them, ſo he is ſometimes and often ſeen to work ſuch events as do not anſwer thoſe Second Cauſes. One would think that ſwiftneſs in running of a Race ſhould carry the Victory, that the ſtrongeſt ſhould in a Battle have the better; and that the Wiſeſt ſhould heap up Riches: yet theſe Succeſſes are by <hi>Solomon</hi> aſcribed to God's Providence, more than to ſuch Second Cauſes, for he ſaith,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.11.</note> 
                  <hi>the race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet favour to men of skill.</hi>

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:41737:49"/>
               <p>Now we are come to the moſt controverted part of God's Providence namely Permiſſion, which is a governing, whereby God doth not reſtrain or bring off Devils and wicked men, ſo prone and inclined to ſin, but withdrawing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his Grace, ſuffereth them to fall into ſin, yet ſo that he turneth their bad and violent inclinations to the execution of his juſt Judgments, and directeth to very good ends their wicked Deſigns and Purpoſes. In the permiſſion of ſin, God is not an idle Spectator, but a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, juſt and wiſe Judge: God's method herein is this. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To men dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, he denyeth and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draweth the effectual helps of his Grace, without which they cannot but ſin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Very often he keeps not form ſinning Devils, and Men of their nature, and out of cuſtom ſo prone to ſin, when he could do't, but ſuffereth them to fall into't. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſin conceived in their mind, he ſo reſtraineth and ruleth, that he ſuffers it not to break out upon every Object; but he inclineth and directeth it to ſuch Objects or Men whom he is willing to Puniſh, Chaſtiſe or Try. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He directeth to a good end, thoſe deſigns which they intend for evil ends; as for inſtance, if a Traveller on his way be killed by a Highway-man, God is ſaid to have permitted the Murther. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe he hath withdrawn and denyed him his effectual Grace, without which he infallibly was to commit a Murther. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe he hath not kept from Murther the mind of that High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man, by nature and cuſtom inclined to it, when he could eaſily have done it, but hath ſuffered him to commit it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> becauſe he ſo inclined and ruled the Highway-man's violence and deſign of committing a Murther, that he neither would or could indifferently kill any Man, but this Man rather than another, hence by a juſt Judgment (which for the moſt part Men know not the cauſe of) he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Highway-man's fury this Traveller, rather than another. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe that which by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man was committed for a bad end, as may be to get money to beſtow upon his own luſt, God directed it for a good end, as may be the Robber's puniſhment, or of him that was killed, or to hinder him from executing ſome
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41737:50"/>evil deſign he was going upon, or ſome other end unknown to us.</p>
               <p>In the Sins of Men, about which Divine Permiſſion is exerciſed, four things are to be obſerved. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The act it ſelf as 'tis a natural act phyſically taken. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The vice inherent to the fact, or the morality of it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The directing of the bad Inſtrument and evil Act to a certain Object. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The end of this direction is that God executeth his juſt Judgments by the ſins of Men. The <hi>firſt, third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> of theſe are of God, and he is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them, for every act as ſuch is good, the motion of the hand, ſtirring of the body are good, the direction of the feet is good, and the execution of God's judgments is very good. But the <hi>ſecond,</hi> wherein properly ſin conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is not of God, but only of Man; wherefore Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is the author of ſin as ſuch. <hi>Arminians</hi> accuſing us to make God the author of ſin, do but follow the ſteps of their Elder Brothers the Papiſts. <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza, &amp;c.</hi> falſely aſperſed by ſlanderers, ſpeak well of this matter.

               <p>This Doctrine, as we ſee, is ſtrongly grounded upon the Word of God, yet by ſome it is aſperſed with the abominable ſlander, that it makes God the Author of ſin, which we call Blaſphemy, and in our Minds and Hearts, we abhor, deteſt, and pronounce a Curſe againſt, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Judge of the World to vindicate our Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency againſt ſo notorious, falſe, and impudent Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. They make God the Author of Sin, who call Sin a poſitive Being, as doth one of their great Men, Dr. <hi>Pierce,</hi> in ſeveral places: For God is the maker of every poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Being, but ſin is a negative Being, which God never was the Author of.

                  </gap> 'Tis a non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God's Law: Wherefore he that calleth Sin a poſitive Being, makes God the Author of it. We ſufficiently declared, how tho' God doth concurr with the natural and Phyſical part of the Act, he hath nothing to do as Author of the Moral, or of the Deviation, no more than the Sun when it ſhineth upon, and ſtirreth Filth and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Earth, and draweth it, but is not thereby in the leaſt defiled, the Corruption and Sin lay in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The wicked is like the Spider, which is wholly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous in it ſelf, and turneth into Poyſon every thing it eateth; contrary to the Bee, which makes Honey out of every Flower. However skilful Apothecaries make Vipers, and other ſuch things Ingredients of their beſt Cordials. Thus God's Wiſdom draweth good out of evil, and light out of darkneſs: He makes uſe of the Malice and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Men to bring his Purpoſes to paſs, and to execute his Judgments, ever remaining as he is, moſt Pure, and a moſt Holy God. <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Inceſt, as it is a Sin, we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

The numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering of a people as a ſin we attribute to Satan, and as a puniſhment to God as a juſt Judge of the whole Earth.

This Satan raiſed in his heart, which made him reject <hi>Joab</hi>'s wholſome advice. In ſome circumſtances this caſe may be parallelled with that of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Kings 20.</note> who ſhewed all his Treaſures to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Ambaſſadors. In it ſelf it was no evil thing, but the Pride and Vanity
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:41737:54"/>that attended, marred it and made it diſpleaſe God: then the good of our actions is of God, the evil of our ſelves.</p>
               <p>This matter being ſo important, to clear it the more, we muſt briefly anſwer ſome objections made againſt it. <hi>Firſt,</hi> He who denyeth ſinners his help, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid ſinning, is partaker to the ſin; but God doth ſo, wherefore he is partaker to the ſin. I anſwer he who denyeth it when bound to help, is partaker to the ſin; but upon God there is no obligation as upon Men to help one another. God is moſt free in all his workings, therefore he is not in fault, as to the guilt of ſin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> They ſay if the wicked do execute God's judgments, yet ſo that their deſigns by God are directed and determined to certain objects, it followeth that either they ſin not, or elſe 'tis not well in God to be angry againſt thoſe who cannot reſiſt his power. We anſwer with a denyal of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, for neither of the two things do follow; wicked Men do ſin, for what they do is not with a deſign to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute God's Judgments, but to ſatisfie their own luſt againſt God's Law; wherefore God without any evil, may make uſe of their ſins; but they are unexcuſable, becauſe they ſin againſt the Law of God, and do that which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, though God doth by them that which is juſt and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; neither is it ill in God to be angry againſt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſin freely and without compulſion; and by their ſins they ſtudy to ſerve themſelves, not God; neither do they, conſult with Providence, but only their own Malice. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Objection, <hi>why doth he yet find fault, for who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted his will?</hi> Is by him anſwered; <hi>But O man who art thou,</hi> &amp;c. whereof we have before given an account. Now that Tyrants cannot execute their injuſtice and cruelty, and ought not to promiſe themſelves impunity, though they be God's inſtruments, it appeareth out of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we made uſe of not long before. <hi>O Aſſyrian the rod of mine anger,</hi> &amp;c. Though God had ſent him to chaſtiſe his people, he had his own private ends, and went on upon his own ſcore; wherefore 'tis added by the Prophet verſe 7.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iſai. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>How be it he meaneth it not ſo, neither doth

               <p>They farther object, he who directs and inclineth Men to this or that ſin, and makes uſe of them as inſtruments, is author of their ſins. We anſwer thus, He who inclineth and directs men not ſinners to this or that ſin, as it is ſin, and makes uſe of them as inſtruments to commit ſin, as it is ſin, is the Author of thoſe ſins; but God, as a wiſe and a juſt Judge, doth not infuſe ſin, but doth incline and direct Men, not unwilling, but willing and ready; not free from, but corrupt with ſin, to this or that ſin, not as ſins, but as Acts whereby as a juſt Judge he executeth his Judgments in and againſt Sinners, according to his eternal Decree; and, as I ſaid before, is no more guilty of their ſins, than the Horſeman that rideth a lame Horſe, is the cauſe of his lameneſs; he ſets him on, thus he is the cauſe of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but not of the lameneſs. And except we admit this, the Blaſphemy of making God the Author of ſin, will fall upon the Word of God it ſelf. For in the fore-quoted places, it calls wicked Men, Inſtruments, Rods, Axes, Saws, Staffs, Battle-axes, Hammers, and attributes their Works to God.<note place="margin">Iſa. 5.26. &amp; chap. 7.18.</note>

               <p>They ſay we affirm, That God hath predeſtinated Men to ſin; but 'tis no fair dealing to charge our Doctors in general: They ſhould quote Names and Places, becauſe out of the conſideration of ſome Antecedents and Conſequents, one can more eaſily know the Doctrine of Authors. Now, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to anſwer moſt Objections againſt this truth, That Man ſinneth with Gods Will and Appointment, we are to take notice of the following Obſervations. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Will of God is either Effective, Permiſſive, or Directive, as we already have ſpoken of. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sin is conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>materially,</hi> as an Act, or <hi>formally,</hi> as a Tranſgreſſion of the Law: Or <hi>Laſtly,</hi> as it is a Puniſhment of God. Theſe things thus premiſed, to remove from our Adverſaries all
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:41737:55"/>occaſions and pretences to blame us, we here ſet down our belief as followeth. Sins <hi>materially</hi> conſidered, are from the Effective and Approbative Will of God, for an Act as an Act is a Poſitive Being, and ſo is Good, and from the chief Good. Sins <hi>formally</hi> conſidered are not from God's Effective, Preceptive or Approbative Will of God; yet are committed by Divine Permiſſion and Direction; the fault is of Men, not of God. Sins conſidered <hi>finally,</hi> in relation to the end of Puniſhments and Divine Judgments, are from God's Effective and Approbative Will: Hence it appears we do not make God the Author of ſin as ſuch, and formally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Farther they object, that ſome of us ſay, ſome Men are predeſtinated to the cauſes of Damnation as ſin, and ſo make God the Author of it. Some may happen to ſay ſo, but we are not ſworn to any private Man's words or opinions; but we ſay that Men ſinners are predeſtinated to Damnation, neither doth Man ſin becauſe he is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Damnation, but is appointed to Damnation becauſe a ſinner. They who are of the opinion here argued againſt, yield the Thing, but deny the Conſequence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God to be the Author of ſin, though he made Man in a condition to fall into ſin, and decreed to permit him to yield to the temptation, and commit ſin to manifeſt his Juſtice in the juſt condemnation of Man ſinner: Then ſay the Adverſaries, God hath not found a guilty Man to be puniſhed, but hath made him ſuch, which is not true, for God made him not ſo, but permitted him to be made ſo; he who thorough his own fault became guilty, is juſtly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by God: Laſtly, they object thus, that which is the cauſe of the cauſe, is alſo the cauſe of the effect, which is only true of the neceſſary cauſe called <hi>per ſe,</hi> not of that <hi>per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens:</hi> but ſay they, you ſay that reprobation is a neceſſary cauſe of ſin, which is a meer untruth and ſlander, none of our Authors ever ſaid or hath written ſo, for 'tis Blaſphemy, except it be through an abuſe of the name: Sometimes 'tis uſual to ſay <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi> a Cauſe without which a thing is not, but 'tis improperly ſo called, for every true Cauſe doth influence the Effect. Thus we have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered their moſt plauſible Objections, and given them their beſt and moſt advantageous light, to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more intelligible.</p>

And 'tis much to be obſerved how this Contingency is wholly and only on the ſide of near, Second, and particular Cauſes, for in relation to the firſt and Univerſal, nothing is Contingent, but all neceſſary, not of a neceſſity of the Cauſe, but of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability.</p>
               <p>Againſt this 'tis objected, if all things be out of an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable neceſſity of God's Providence, then Counſels, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and Prayers of godly Men are of no uſe, for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are taken to obtain a good ſucceſs of our undertakings, and avoid bad ones, prayers are made to get good things and avoid evil ones, but if all things be done by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Providence, theſe are in vain; which we deny for this reaſon, that Counſels and Prayers are means ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to God's Providence, whence God granteth proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſs to prudent Counſels and pious prayers; God in his word bindeth us to theſe means; thus the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins is an Article of our Creed, 'tis matter of Faith, for we believe it; yet in the Lord's Prayer we are commanded to pray God to forgive our treſpaſſes. And if ſometimes he doth not hear us, yet our Counſels and Prayers are not altogether in vain, for they who uſe the means which God hath preſcribed, do perform their duty and ſerve God, not without benefit one way or other, and the ſame thing we pray for, though not granted for the

                  <hi>Saints</hi> pray for thoſe things which they know will be infallibly. They which uſe this argument againſt prayers, diſpute like thoſe who deny the world ſhall be conſumed with Fire, becauſe by an unchangeable Decree it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Now theſe Counſels and Prayers are not made uſe of as lets thereby to change the Decrees and ſtop the courſe of Providence, but to the end that yielding obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's law, and following the uſual courſe of providence, we may obtain a good Conſcience and be filled with good hope, leaving the ſucceſs of what we pray for, to the moſt wiſe God. A laſt Objection is this, if God's actual Providence be immutable, then none of God's precepts or promiſes are conditional, for a condition doth imply a poſſibility of change to the contrary, according to the performance or no performance of the condition; but it doth not follow, neither is the proof univerſally true, but falſe in particular as to the condition of God's precepts or promiſes, it is uncertain only on Man's ſide, for on God's ſide, it is moſt certainly decreed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined.</p>
               <p>Though already we ſufficiently declared we ought not to ſeparate the means from the end, yet becauſe about theſe diſputes it is a fundamental truth, I cannot forbear for confirmation of it, here to inſert two Inſtances, one out of the Old Teſtament, the other out of the New. The <hi>firſt</hi> is concerning King<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Kings 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> after God had ſent him word by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to prepare for Death, and (here by the by, take notice how the laſt meſſage differed from the firſt) given him a Reprieve for fifteen years, though without any means God might have cured him, yet he is pleaſed to make uſe of ſome, and the remedy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed was proper for the Diſeaſe, for a lump of Figs which are a great drawer is laid upon the Boile which thereupon broke, and ſo the malignant humour came out. The other inſtance out of the New Teſtament is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable:<note n="(c)" place="margin">Acts 27.</note> Amidſt the great danger of Shipwrack which <hi>Paul</hi> and other Men in the Ship, were under, God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him not only his life, but alſo of all them that were

               <p>Now all that remaineth for me to ſay upon this whole matter, is to obſerve how many a good uſe may be made of the Doctrine of Divine Providence, and ſo conclude with it. And <hi>firſt</hi> out of the adminiſtration of all things, we muſt own the infinite Power, Wiſdom and goodneſs of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We ought to put our truſt and confidence in God, as a Father who takes a ſpecial care of all his. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In adverſity we muſt not look ſo much upon Second Cauſes as upon the firſt; and whatſoever we ſuffer, we muſt own it to come from the hand of God; and in proſperity, we muſt acknowledge and praiſe God as the Author of every good thing we enjoy:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Job. 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>For at the hand of God we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive both good and evil.</hi> Then we ought to fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence ſo potent a God in whoſe hands is every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which he can arm all againſt us. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Fire, and hail, ſnow and vapour, ſtormy winde fullfilling his word.

This alſo layes an obligation upon us, when there is occaſion, to make uſe of the means God hath preſcribed, yet not ſo as to put our truſt in them; neither are we to deſpair in caſe they fail us, knowing how God is not ſo tyed to them, but that he may help us without, ſo that upon all occaſions of whatſoever nature they be, we ought to ſubmit, to truſt and depend upon God's providence, and in conformity to God, we ought to follow our Work and Duty.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Word <hi>Free-will,</hi> doth properly denote the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul, called the Will, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Queſtion, the Underſtanding, and other faculties of the Soul, are alſo underſtood thereby, in as much as the Will is enlightned by the Intellect, and followeth the laſt Dictates of it; ſo that it is the guide of Will and Affections. Now the Queſtion is about the power of all Natural faculties of Man; how far they may go in promoting of his own Salvation. This is called <hi>Free-will,</hi> and we are to ſee how much Nature, which here is oppoſed to Grace, can promote or hinder our Salvation. <hi>Pelagians</hi> do ſay, that by Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Law of Nature, through the direction of right Reaſon, Men may be ſaved; that is, by Nature with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Grace. So that the right uſe of Nature, by infallible dependence, draws the Grace of Regeneration, which is to ſettle a ſoundneſs of Nature ſo contrary to what is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the whole courſe of Scripture. But theſe I paſs by to come to others, <hi>(Papiſts)</hi> who go not ſo far, yet in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Salvation give Nature too much, for in part they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to Nature, and in part to Grace. Sin, ſay they, hath not taken away the Power of the Underſtanding, and of the Will of Man, to obey God, and to believe, but only the exerciſe of that Power; that the power of Man's Soul, to all good Works, is not dead, but only chained up, and bound, and in the act of Converſion, the effect of it doth depend part upon Grace, and part upon Man's own Strength. About this part of farthering our Salvation, <hi>Arminians</hi> do mince the matter, and are ſometimes on and off, if not wholly, yet in part; but as to the other point
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41737:60"/>of Man's natural power to hinder Grace and Salvation, they highly, and altogether, are for it, as it will appear when we ſpeak about reſiſtibility of Grace.</p>
               <p>But as neither Free-will, nor any natural faculty, hath any power to purchaſe the beginning, or progreſs of our Salvation, for <hi>both Grace and Glory,</hi> as after <hi>David,</hi> I ſaid before,<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.11.</note> 
                  <hi>come from God,</hi> who alone quickeneth Nature dead in Sin, ſo Nature cannot hinder the Almighty power of God in the Converſion of Sinners, except one will affirm the power of Men to be greater than that of God; which is downright Blaſphemy. We ſay, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Man, through his Fall, is ſo corrupt, that by Nature there is not in him any power at all to any Spiritual good, rather a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity and inclination to all kind of Spiritual evil; ſo that our Will, inſtead of being free, is a Servant and a Slave to ſin.

                  <hi>God ſaw that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually.</hi> The Text is very full and comprehenſive in every word thereof, if any thing can be added to it, elſewhere we find it thus:<note n="(h)" place="margin">Jer. 17.9.</note> 
                  <hi>The heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can know it?</hi> We ſometimes find, by experience, how a Man deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately in love with a Daughter of <hi>Belial,</hi> I mean a Woman without any Fortune, Honour or Virtue, will confeſs he is in an error, and over-ruled by a Paſſion, yet though to the ruin of himſelf and Fortune, he muſt have her, or elſe he cannot live; and is not a Natural man's Will deſperately wicked? So that though he hath checks and convictions of Conſcience about his evil courſes, with his being ſo fond of the World, and ſo much in love with Sin, and though he knows better, yet he neither can, nor will leave it; where is here Free-will? where ſufficient Grace? If it is not to be found in thoſe Natural and Temporal things, much leſs in Spiritual and Eternal; O, let every one lay his hand upon his Conſcience, and ſeriouſly examine himſelf.</p>
               <p>Another thing we aſſert, is, That whatſoever good or ſpiritual working is found in any Man, it comes from God, who worketh it in Man; nothing of Nature, but all of Grace. Our being Enlightned, Converſion, Repentance, Holineſs, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> come all from God alone,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Iſa. 26.12.</note>

                  <hi>It is God that worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure.</hi> It doth not lye in our free-will, nor is it in our power, to receive or reject Grace; neither do we thereby deſtroy the natural liberty of the Will, which doth not conſiſt in indifferency, that is, to chooſe, or to reject this or that, but in a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from compulſion; neither doth the immutability of the Decree take it away, that which God hath Decreed ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neceſſarily be, but a thing may be done voluntarily and neceſſarily too, for neceſſity and liberty in one ſubject do very well agree. Thus God is neceſſarily good, yet
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41737:61"/>moſt freely good; the Devil is freely evil, yet neceſſarily evil. Saints in Heaven do neceſſarily praiſe God, for they can do no otherwiſe, yet they do it moſt freely and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily; nothing but a neceſſity of coaction, a forcible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, takes away liberty, and this the Will of Man is free from. Wicked Men do neceſſarily, yet freely ſin with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and delight;<note n="(d)" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.14.</note> 
                  <hi>they cannot ceaſe from ſin.</hi> Theſe are Scripture words, yet our Adverſaries, as before, clamour thus; then, after this, all Precepts, Promiſes, Threatnings and Exhortations to make Men abſtain from Sin, will be in vain, if they cannot forbear ſinning. But, I ſay, though ſome be not the better, rather the worſe for theſe things, yet ſuch things are not in vain, for thereby they are taught their Duty, and commanded and exhorted to perform it; and thereby unpenitent and unbelievers become unexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for they cannot pretend ignorance. Neither is it in vain, in relation to the Elect, who enjoy theſe outward means together with Reprobates, becauſe thorough the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward working of the Spirit, the Preaching of theſe things becomes effectual in them, and puts them upon avoiding of Sin.</p>
               <p>In few words, the better to underſtand this matter of <hi>Free-will,</hi> two things ought chiefly to be conſidered: <hi>Firſt,</hi> What a ſtate Man is in when we ſpeak of his Free-will. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> The nature of the things which he doth exerciſe his Free-will about. There are four ſtates of Man, which Schoolmen call <hi>Inſtitutus, Deſtitutus, Reſtitutus, Praeſtitutus;</hi> that is, to be more plain, of Innocency, Nature, Grace, and Glory. The things are either neceſſary or natural, indifferent, mix'd or ſpiritual. The ſtate of Innocency needs not to be ſpoken of, 'tis loſt and gone in <hi>Adam;</hi> of whom Divines ſay, <hi>Habebat poſſe quod veltet.</hi> He had Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will and Power to do what he would, though at laſt he wanted the Will to do what he could, for he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his Integrity.</p>
               <p>In the other three ſtates, the Will is free from compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and coaction, elſe, inſtead of being <hi>voluntas,</hi> it would be <hi>noluntas,</hi> not <hi>Will,</hi> but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nwill;</hi> God himſelf never offers ſuch a violence, whereby its nature would be deſtroyed
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:41737:61"/>So then, in the ſtate of Nature, the Will is free only to Evil; in that of Grace, part to Good and part to Evil, yet ſo, that the Evil is wholly from our ſelves, and the Good only from God; in that of Glory only to Good. 'Tis to be obſerved, how, in the paſſing out of the ſtate of Nature into that of Grace, that is, at the time of our Converſion, God, by his holy Spirit, works in us againſt us, I mean, our natural corrupt inclinations. But afterwards he works in us and by us; that is, he guides, inclines, and turns our faculties to that which is good and acceptable in his ſight. But to come nearer, We ſay, in the ſtate of Nature, in Natural and Neceſſary things, as to eat and to drink, which are natural and neceſſary to preſerve Life, yea, this or that kind of Meat and Drink, man's Will is moſt free; ſo 'tis in indifferent things, as to Walk, Stand, or Sit, to Game, Sing, or the like. The Will is very free even in thoſe things that are of a mix'd nature, and which ſeem to imply a violence; as when a Man gives his Purſe to a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-Man to ſave his Life; when, in a Storm, Merchants and Seamen caſt the Wares into the Sea, to ſave the Ship and themſelves. Though, in ſuch caſes, there be an unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs and a repugnancy to the thing, yet the <hi>Will</hi> deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines it ſelf, of two Evils to chooſe the leaſt; but our Queſtion, concerning Free-will, is not about ſuch Objects, but about Spiritual things, in this ſtate of Nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Converſion.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, we ſay, the Will is free only to do Evil, moſt willing with greedineſs. In this caſe, with Scripture, we call it a Slave, a Drudge, and a Servant to Sin, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ceaſe from Sin; wiſe and willing enough to Sin, but without knowledge and willingneſs to do good:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 6.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Whom man doth obey, his ſervant he is to whom he doth obey.</hi> That Will that obeys Sin in the luſts thereof, as every Will in its ſtate of Nature doth, Sin, ſaith the Apoſtle, reigneth in it as in the Mortal body; ſuch <hi>Will</hi> is in the ſnare of the Devil, and<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Tim. 2.26.</note> taken Captive by him at his Will, ſaith the ſame Apoſtle. In this unregenerate ſtate, the Soul, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the <hi>Will,</hi> is dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; <hi>the natural man receives not the things of the ſpirit of God, for they are fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:41737:62"/>unto him: neither can he know them, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. And <hi>the carnal Mind,</hi> and Will too, <hi>is enmity againſt God;</hi> before our reconciliation to God we are his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. both in Soul and Body, in every faculty of the one, and in every member of the other. In ſhort, the whole ſtream of Scripture runs ſtrong that way, to ſhew how, in the ſtate of Nature, there is no more poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility for our Will, of it ſelf, to be carried to good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual objects,<note place="margin">Jerem. 13.23.</note> than there is in the <hi>Aethiopian to change his skin, or in the Leopard to change his ſpots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in the ſtate of Grace, as to <hi>Free-will,</hi> in relation to ſpiritual things, for thoſe of another nature come not within the queſtion, though the <hi>Will</hi> remaineth free from compulſion, yet we ought to conſider it in a twofold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, according to the two different Principles that are in us, the Fleſh and the Spirit, the Old and the New Man, of a quite different and contrary nature one to another; the <hi>Fleſh</hi> hath her Luſts, which muſt be Crucified; the <hi>Old Man</hi> hath his Deeds, which ought to be Mortified, all by degrees, and after a fight, wherein the Spirit of God, thorough Chriſt's Blood, giveth a regenerate Man the Victory, not the <hi>Iſrael after the fleſh,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.18.</note> but to that after the ſpirit and the promiſe.</p>
               <p>What this New Man is, St. <hi>Paul</hi> mentions to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> 4.19. <hi>My little Children, of whom I travail in birth until Chriſt be formed in you;</hi> that is, the Image and likeneſs of Chriſt in Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and every Chriſtian Virtue; of this formation, the Apoſtle, by the means of the Miniſtery of the Word, was the Inſtrument, but the Holy Ghoſt, not the Will of Man, the Efficient Cauſe; it is that Wind that bloweth where it liſteth, and though one heareth the ſound thereof, one cannot tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. In ſome kind we may ſay of it, what <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of his Body made in ſecret, at firſt imperfect, but in continuance faſhioned, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.15, 16. This puts a new or ſpiritual Life in us, ſo that every one, in that bleſſed condition, may with St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt lives in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. I know, I will, I love, and I do, yet not I, but Chriſt by his holy Spirit, knoweth, willeth, loveth, and doth in me; and even as after the birth of our
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41737:62"/>Body, to preſerve and ſtrengthen it, food muſt be given it, and Milk is the firſt, ſo muſt the New Man be fed with Milk till it be able to bear Meat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2. but this forming, feeding and digeſting, is the Work of God, and not an effect of the choice of our Will. Thus much I could not forbear taking notice of, as to that Spiritual Principle within us.</p>
               <p>Well, both theſe Principles retain the Nature whence they come: <hi>The firſt of the earth, earthy; the ſecond is the Lord from heaven, heavenly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.47. Now that firſt and Old Man anſwereth, <hi>The Jeruſalem that now is, and is in bondage with her Children, but Jeruſalem which is above is free,</hi> Gal. 4.25, 26. We then muſt ſay, that <hi>where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.17. where that Spirit is not, there is nothing but bondage; ſo then, in the twain Man are both liberty and bondage upon different accounts. What <hi>Paul</hi> doth, he alloweth not, <hi>for, what I would that I do not, but what I hate that do I.</hi> He delighteth in the Law of God after the inward Man, but the Law of the Members bringeth him into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which he deſired to be delivered from, and obtained it through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Wherefore, in that ſtate, though the corrupt principle would pull back and miſlead our Will, yet, by the guidance and direction of the Holy Ghoſt, our Will is made tractable, inclined, and, without any violence, turned willingly to Spiritual things. Thus we are made a free, willing People, in the day of God's Power, to <hi>the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing every thought,</hi> and every deſire too, <hi>into Captivity, to the obedience of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4, 5. As to our Free-will in the State of Glory, I paſs it by, there being no queſtion made about it.</p>
               <p>The Controverſie about Free-will is a large Subject, yet, I think, we ſaid enough to our preſent purpoſe; what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be ſpoken about it, ſhall be under another head, which, that we now leave, doth directly lead us to. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> are ſtiff ſticklers for a Free-will in Man, to receive or reject Grace, when offered by the Preaching of the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41737:63"/>Goſpel, as the outward means appointed for that end. Now we proceed.</p>

               <p>TO underſtand this well, it muſt be well ſtated; the Queſtion is not whether Man can, and doth reſiſt Grace, when offered in the Preaching of the Word, or even ſome good motions of the ſpirit of God; we are all agreed it can, and doth. But the true ſtate of the Queſtion between <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> with <hi>Arminians</hi> and us, is this, Whether, when God doth offer men Grace, with a deſign to have them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by converted? Whether or not, I ſay thoſe Men ſhall actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be converted? Or, Whether the Free-will and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man, ſhall overcome the motions of the ſpirit of God, when he purpoſeth actually to convert? We ſay, at that time, God works irreſiſtibly and invincibly; that is, they ſhall be converted; they ſay no.</p>

                  <hi>Arminians</hi> as well as <hi>papiſts</hi> are of a contrary opinion, they aſſert Converſion to depend ſo much upon Man's free-will, that there ſhall be no efficacy of Grace, no effect of God's Mind to Convert, all things uſed towards it ſhall be in vain; if Man doth not anſwer God's end, and therein he hath his Free will, ſo far as not to anſwer if he hath not a mind, and wholly diſappoint God's deſign to convert him, thus converting grace may be reſiſted, and in vain God will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, if Man be not willing to it, which is to make God depend upon Man, and not Man upon God. In effect they own no other converting grace but a moral perſuaſion, whereby out of God's words, unregenerate Men are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prevailed upon to believe, to repent, hope, juſt as one Man bringeth arguments to perſuade another; thus Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is not wrought in Man but by Man, which is meer <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This they endeavour to prove out of Scripture, and bring examples of ſome whom God would have Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, towards whoſe Converſion he made uſe of means, yet to no purpoſe, becauſe thoſe people would not be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.

                  <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walketh in a way that was not good.</hi> To this I anſwer, there always hath been ſome who obeyed not the outward Call and Precept of God; but God never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Converſion of ſuch, becauſe he did not beſtow upon them true Converting Grace, which conſiſteth in the working of the Holy Ghoſt upon their hearts: As to the place about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Chriſt would have gathered them with the will of <hi>precept;</hi> that is, he commanded them to come and be gathered to him, to ſhew them their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But Chriſt would never gather them with the will of the <hi>Decree,</hi> whereby he is willing to Convert the Elect, who are the only Men actually to be coverted. As to the <hi>Second</hi> Text, thoſe Men are ſaid to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt who refuſe to obey what he doth command, and theſe Precepts are directed either to Reprobates or to the Elect, to the former, Converting Grace is never given, ſo they are never Converted but ever continue diſobedient: As for the Elect, though ſometimes they reject the outward vocation, yet at laſt by the inward calling, they are all converted, ſo that the inward grace is not beſtowed in vain upon any of them. To the <hi>third,</hi> I anſwer, if they to whom God ſpread out his hands be not converted, the hands of God were not ſpread for their Converſion; and this ſpreading out of hands is nothing elſe but the outward calling, which true converting grace is not always joyned with, ſo that the end of it is not the Converſion of Reprobates but their Conviction; and to leave them without excuſe; out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place of Scripture they object how God made uſe<note n="(d)" place="margin">Iſai. 5.1, 2, 3, 4.</note> of all neceſſary helps towards the Converſion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet they were not converted: As to Reprobates amongſt thoſe <hi>Jews,</hi> 'tis falſe, that all neceſſary helps to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion were afforded them, but ſay they, if all ſuch means had not been afforded, how could God have ſaid, what could have been done to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41737:65"/>But all this is ſaid only as to outward means, which if the Vineyard had not been bad, might have been ſufficient to make her bear fruit; God compareth himſelf to the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who hath performed his part, when he hath taken all the outward care that belongeth to him; but again, ſay they (for I am willing to give their arguments their whole ſtrength) looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes, which is a ſign he manured it in hopes to have fruit by it; but a looking for and expectation are improperly ſaid of God, ſo that here that expreſſion ſignifieth only that God required of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to have done her part and performed her duty; this is juſt as if one ſhould ſay, God hoped for that to be which ſhall never be, which is to father ignorance or great impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon God, for he that hopeth for that to be, which ſhall not be, either he cannot foreſee that which is to come, or if he knoweth that ſhall not be, he is not wiſe to hope for it.</p>
               <p>In few words to conclude this, a general rule to anſwer moſt or all objections is, that all means afforded Men for their Converſion if they be not effectual, are only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, never intended of God for their Converſion, for elſe God had applyed the inward means, without which the outward are uneffectual, and ſo they had been converted.</p>
               <p>We muſt anſwer an objection more of theirs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour by the grace of God to beat them out of their ſtrong hold, as they take it to be, but are miſtaken in the meaning of the place, and ſo miſapply it. The words are theſe,<note place="margin">Chap. 18.31, &amp; 33.11.</note> 
                  <hi>why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael,</hi> contained in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> whence they would conclude, if they will 'tis in their own power not to die, whereby their Life and Salvation is lodged in their own hand, and wholly depends upon their will.</p>
               <p>In order to an anſwer, we are in our way to take notice of ſeveral truths conducing to the point, aſſerted by the Prophet. As <hi>firſt,</hi> that God puniſheth not one Man for the ſins of another, according to a common proverb among them. <hi>The fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and the childrens teeth are ſet on edge,</hi> but God declareth poſitively
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41737:65"/>againſt it when he ſaith, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall die.</hi> The people, as all Men are apt to do, would have excuſed themſelves, as if they had born the iniquities of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but God in moſt part of the Chapter doth vindicate his dealings, how he neither abſolves the Guilty nor puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes the Innocent, a moſt infallible truth and effect of God's Juſtice, which yet ſome, apt to wreſt Scripture, would gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay out of the 4th. Commandment; <hi>God viſiteth the iniquity of the Fathers upon the Children,</hi> Exod. 20.5. Which our Bleſſed Saviour explains thus, when Children commit and continue in their ſins, and fill up the meaſure of their Fathers: <hi>fill ye up the meaſure of your fathers:</hi> This I point at,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.32.</note> to ſhew how cautious we ought to be, in the Expoſition of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, not to go againſt the Analogy of Faith, and make the word of God contradict it ſelf, which our Adverſaries become guilty of in this place.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Second</hi> truth, which is a Concluſion from the firſt, here aſſerted, is this; <hi>The Lord's way is equal, but the people's ways are unequal.</hi> Thus God muſt be owned to be juſt in all his ways, and every Man and People guilty in theirs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let every mouth be ſtopped before God. A <hi>Third</hi> truth, is this: As the Father ſhall not ſuffer for the ſin of the Son, nor the Son for that of the Father; ſo, to encourage Men to repentance, both Son and Father or any one elſe that leaves his wickedneſs and truely repents, God will pardon his former tranſgreſſions, and they ſhall not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So likewiſe, they who for a time have morally and ſeemingly lived well and avoided ſin, if they fall into wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and follow evil courſes, they ſhall be puniſhed for the ſame without any regard to their former be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
               <p>Here before I proceed, I muſt remove a difficulty ariſing out of the words <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs,</hi> upon which the Adverſaries would ground one of their Errors, as if a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly righteous Man that is elected and juſtified, could fall from true ſaving grace and be damned, which is againſt Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as I clearly demonſtrate it in a Charpter of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of mine: however ſome few words I muſt ſay in relation to this Text. The word righteous hath in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:41737:66"/>two different ſences. <hi>Firſt,</hi> When one is really and truly ſuch, as whenſoever the name is given to the Lord Jeſus,<note place="margin">Iſai. 53.11. &amp; 1 John 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>my righteous ſervant</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous:</hi> But here the queſtion being about men, of ſo many places we ſhall produce but one to our purpoſe, <hi>if the righteous be ſcarcely ſaved,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.18.</note> 
                  <hi>where ſhall the ungodly and ſinner appear?</hi> The truly righteous Man is meant here, and therefore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ungodly: But Scripture ſometimes calls thoſe righteous who are ſuch only in ſhew and appea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance, and that's the ſignification of the word in this place; for, <hi>a truly righteous man doth not finally turn from his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, nor do according to all the abominations that the wicked man doth.</hi> And for a farther confirmation of what I ſay, it cannot be denyed, that a legal righteouſneſs is here ſpoken of, as <hi>verſe</hi> 19.21. <hi>to keep all my ſtatutes.</hi> But the queſtion between us is about Evangelical righteouſneſs, which is through Faith, and not by Works, and this legal righteouſneſs here ſpoken of, muſt be owned to be unpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and not to be found in any Man. Now that it is the ſtile of God's word, to call righteous and righteouſneſs that which is not really, but only ſeemingly ſo, it's clear: thus our Saviour ſaith in the Goſpel,<note place="margin">Luke 5.32.</note> 
                  <hi>I eame not to call the righteous,</hi> that are ſuch in their own opinion, <hi>but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.28.</note> And to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Ye alſo outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocriſie and iniquity; and except your righteouſneſs ſhall exceed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Scribes and Phariſees ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> Matth. 5.20. This Phariſaical righteouſneſs was not really ſuch, but hypocritical, only in ſhew and for oſtentation, men do ſometimes fanſie themſelves to be righteous, when they are not. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> adviſeth, <hi>be not righteous over much,</hi> that is in thine own conceit, ſuch was the Angel of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.16. Rev. 3.17.</note> who ſaid, <hi>I am rich and increaſed with goods, and have need of nothing,</hi> when he was <hi>wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to come juſt to the point, God having declared unto the people their tranſgreſſions as the Cauſe of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; he commandeth them to repent and turn from all their ſins; having ſhewed the diſtemper doth propoſe the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41737:66"/>remedy and preſſes the uſe of it; herein God revealeth to them their duty, what they ought, but not what they can do; they may not pretend ignorance, for here is a warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and thereby they are acquainted with the Maſters will, and if they do not what they are commanded, Death lies at their door, and they are without excuſe. Here, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had done before, <hi>are ſet before them life and death,</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> but being like not to chuſe well, God expoſtulates with them, <hi>why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> No Man, but very few wretches whom God leaves under a fit of deſpair, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to die of a natural death, but would gladly live a day longer, even thoſe that are moſt ſubmiſſive to God's Providence, much leſs is any willing to die of eternal death; wherefore we muſt obſerve that the queſtion doth not directly tend to ſhew the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is willing to die; but rather that the ways of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> tend to death. Death it ſelf is no good nor deſirable thing, 'tis a deprivation of life, the beſt thing in nature, and deſtruction for a time of a ſtrict union, and of a noble Being; but often that which men deſire not, befalls them, becauſe they fall into a way conducing to it; 'tis not the end they propoſe to themſelves, but 'tis the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that happens unto them. A man who is very prodigal of his Eſtate, fallen into great exceſs of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and debauchery, may very well be asked, <hi>Why will you ruin and kill your ſelf?</hi> though he intends no ſuch thing; but is engaged in a courſe of life that will lead him to it. Thus upon ſuch a bottom, is grounded this expoſtulation of God with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> as if he had ſaid, the way ye are in ſhall bring you to death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, therefore turn from it if you will live, and avoid judgments temporal as ſpiritual, for we ſee the former, are meant as out of <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.21.</p>
               <p>A thing here chiefly to be taken notice of, is that all this doth wholly run upon the Covenant of works, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> for 'tis ſaid, <hi>Wherefore I cauſed them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderneſs,</hi>

                  <hi>and gave them my ſtatutes; and ſhewed them my judgments, which if a man do he ſhall live in them.</hi> And conſequently doth
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:41737:67"/>not reach our queſtion about the Covenant of Grace and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Chriſt, when offered upon his own terms. Now Chriſtians do not or muſt not ſtand upon that old Covenant <hi>which was not faultleſs,</hi>

                  <hi>or elſe no place ſhould have been found out for the ſecond, which is a better covenant, eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon better promiſes.</hi> Now as Perfect Obedience, the condition of the old Covenant, was impoſſible for Men to perform, ſo is Faith under the new Covenant, a condition impoſſible for Men of themſelves to attain unto, 'tis not found in Nature, nor amongſt Works, but 'tis a gift of God, and none have it but thoſe whom he is pleaſed to beſtow it upon: The houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is willing to die, and the reaſon is, becauſe naturally they are ſo inclined; dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ignorance and blindneſs are the natural portion of humane nature.<note place="margin">John 14 10.11.</note> When <hi>he that was and is the life and light of men, came into the world, and that the light ſhined in dark neſs, yet darkneſs comprehended him not: The world was made by him, and the world knew him not: He came to his own, and his own received him not,</hi> becauſe Men loved darkneſs more than light. This is the reaſon why people will die, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they love not life, there is a natural impoſſiblity. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>How can Men, naturally dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to live? What <hi>will</hi> is left in them, tends not to ſpiritual life, but for death; if there be ſuch ſtrong inclinations in a good Man, what muſt it be in the wicked? Though the Angels had aſſured <hi>Lot</hi> they were come to deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> and haſtned him out of it; yet he lingered, had no mind to come out, till they to ſave him, were forced to lay hold upon his hand, and as it were force him out of it; they certainly might have put to him the queſtion, <hi>why wilt thou die?</hi> Seeing he ſtaied as it were to be involved in the deſtruction of the place; and his Wife how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing was ſhe to leave it, and contrary to the Angels order, ſhe muſt needs look behind, either out of curioſity, or a deſire to go back.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:41737:67"/>to think and ſee how averſe Men are from their good, and prone to their own miſchief; we muſt conclude thoſe Men to be willing to die, that are unwilling to live, which will not turn from the paths of death.

I ſay a thing which to ſome will ſeem ſtrange, yet to my certain knowledge 'tis very true, how in ſome parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> chiefly in the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> there are thoſe men who ſell themſelves to be Slaves in the Galleys, ſome for a ſhorter, ſome for a longer time, and ſome for life, and undergo the ſame Drudgery as do thoſe who are put in there for great crimes: Nay, there be thoſe, who having as Malefactors continued there for a long time, after their time was expired, of their own accord returned thither.

               <p>This I ſhall conclude with an obſervation upon the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which God propoſeth, to prevent their death and ruin; namely, to repent, <hi>v.</hi> 30. and to <hi>make them a new heart and a new ſpirit.</hi> Here God ſpeaks as one who inſiſts upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Articles, thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul,</hi>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41737:68"/>which for them 'tis impoſſible to perform; wherefore he hath another way of ſpeaking for thoſe whom he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to favour, he doth not command to do, but promiſeth himſelf to do for them:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ezek. 11.19.</note>

               <p>AS one depth calleth to another, ſo doth one Error to another; our Adverſaries are not ſatisified to make Man, if he be willful and obſtinate, ſtronger than God, when he hath a mind to take poſſeſſion of a Soul; but they go farther, and aſſert, That after God is actually in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that Soul, he may be turned out of poſſeſſion; which is their true ſence of the point we are now going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Queſtion is, Whether a Man truly convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and regenerated, can to the end perſevere in the ſtate of Salvation he is actually in? And whether it be poſſible for ſuch a one who is Elected in Chriſt, called with an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Calling, totally and finally to fall from God, and be Damned? This is the true ſtate of the caſe; and not whether the Elect and true Believers can fall into great ſins, which they do too often, as it appeareth out of Scripture and Experience.</p>
               <p>We ſay, That God makes to perſevere and go on to the end, all the Elect and true Believers, whether their Faith be ſtrong or weak, provided it be true, that when once they are in the right way of Grace, they ſhall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly come to Glory, it being not poſſible for the Elect to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Reprobates, to Apoſtatize, and finally, fall to Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

                  <hi>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would, no doubt, have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be manifeſt that they were not all of us.</hi> Who are thoſe that do not perſevere, but fall away from Truth and Grace? They
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:41737:70"/>who never had it, for if they had been true Members of Chriſt, they certainly would have always continued ſo, but God let them go, to let Men know they were not ſound, nor build by Faith on the Rock, for if they had been, they would have continued ſtedfaſt amidſt temptations, and the Gates of Hell could not have prevailed againſt them; like thoſe fiery vapours in the Air, which the Eye would take to be Stars, but by their fall they ſhew what they were. Thus God not only publickly puniſheth thoſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, but makes them an example for others to take warning by; and let this be a rule, that they who fall ſo, either they never were Elect, nor had true Grace, or elſe they are not fallen finally, but God will reſtore them again.<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.

Joh. 6.14.39.40. 1 Joh 3.9.</note> Many other places of Scripture I could bring to confirm this Doctrine, but becauſe I already made uſe of ſome before, which would be ſit for our purpoſe, I omit it, only I ſet ſome in the Margin to be peruſed by the Reader.</p>
               <p>Againſt this Truth 'tis objected, If the Elect cannot periſh, then they need not forbear ſinning to avoid ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Death, let them take what courſe they pleaſe they are ſure of Heaven. This Argument is grounded upon Impiety, 'tis rather of a Reprobate than of an Elect; if the Saints ſhould, againſt their conſcience, obſtinately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in ſin, no doubt but they ſhould periſh; but God, who will not ſuffer his choſen to periſh, doth not leave them to continue in impenitency, but through repentance brings them again to himſelf, and reſtraineth them with putting them in mind of their Duty, for a final obſtinacy in ſin and impenitence; do no more conſiſt with Election, and true ſaving Grace, than a final perſeverance in Faith doth conſiſt with Reprobation. In the 2d place they object the examples of <hi>David, Solomon</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> who fell into abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſins of Adultery and Murder, of Idolatry, and the denying of Chriſt. We ever granted corruption to be ſo ſtrong in the beſt of God's People, that if for a while he withdraweth the exerciſe of his Graces, they are apt to fall into the worſt of ſins; however, we deny that the three named did wholly and totally fall from Grace, only for a time, Grace did ſtill continue in them like fire under
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:41737:70"/>Aſhes. Two reaſons we have to believe they did not final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall; the firſt, Becauſe they ſinned out of weakneſs and human frailty, not with a full conſent of the Will. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe they ſeriouſly repented, which is a true ſign of Faith. As to the repentance of<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13. &amp; Pſal. 51 Mat. 26.75.</note> 
                  <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> it is expreſly ſet down in Scripture; as to <hi>Solomon,</hi> moſt Divines are of opinion, that for a token of repentance, he did write his Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They argue farther, our Saviour ſaith,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Luk. 8.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Some for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away;</hi> therefore ſome may fall from the Faith. The queſtion is not about temporal, but ſaving and juſtifying Faith, which temporal Faith is not: Now in this place 'tis clear our Saviour ſpeaks of temporal Faith; <hi>They believe but for a time.</hi> And out of the Parable it appears, that of the four ſeveral ſorts of ground which the Seed falls into, there is but one that is good; ſo of four kinds of hearts, there is none good but the honeſt and good heart, which having heard the Word keepeth it, and brings forth Fruit. Now ſuch hearts as theſe keep Grace, do continue and perſevere in it, and never loſe it totally. The temporal Faith ſpoken of here, is only an outward profeſſion, and not the power of true Religion; in this ſame ſence is to be taken what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19.</note> 
                  <hi>of ſome who concerning faith have made ſhipwrack.</hi> They made an outward profeſſion of the Goſpel, which at laſt they fell from; ſo that whenſoever mention is made of falling from Grace, from Faith, from the Truth, 'tis only mentioned of the outward profeſſion of it, or of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Faith, but not of true ſaving Grace; when 'tis ſaid,<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.12. &amp; Rom. 11.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Let him that thinks he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay that any fall from the Faith, but he teacheth them how they ought, and can prevent falling from it, namely, to have a care not to run into Carnal ſecurity; ſuch warning are effectual means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Holy Ghoſt keepeth Believers upon Duty, and doth preſerve them from falls. Though our firſt Parents fell, it doth not follow the Saints ſhould do ſo too, the reaſon is, God gave them only the Grace whereby they might continue in Innocency if they would, but the Will he gave
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:41737:71"/>them not, but to Elect and Believers is given Grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only they can, but alſo they are<note n="(f)" place="margin">Philip. 2.12.</note> willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere.

                  <hi>who have known the way of righteouſneſs and depart from it;</hi> but there is a great difference between turning from ſaving Faith and Grace, and turning from the way of righteouſneſs, which the Apoſtle in the ſame verſe calleth the <hi>holy commandment;</hi> that is, the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <hi>not many wiſe after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called and few are choſen:</hi> Chriſt's people in reſpect of others have been always few, yet none but theſe are elected, adopted, effectually called, juſtified ſanctified, glorified or endued with any grace ſufficient to Salvation; and if this be true, as it is, can there be any univerſal grace? to prove this paucity or few-in the judgment of all Proteſtants, rather than multitude and univerſality, hath, Being comparatively taken, been a Character of Chriſt's Church.</p>
               <p>Thus far we have conſidered this pretended univerſal ſufficient Grace in the extent thereof, as to Times, Places and Perſons, which doth relate to the means conducing to Salvation afforded unto men. Now we muſt conſider it in Man himſelf, as it is in the Soul: I would find to know how it cometh in there, is it a natural inherent faculty of the Will? If ſo then 'tis no grace, for in relation to ſpiritual things and to Salvation, Nature and works are oppoſed to Grace; by Nature we are Children of Wrath, but through Grace we are Sons of God, and to make it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is meer <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> (which our Adverſaries dare not openly to own) for <hi>Pelagius</hi> uſed to cloth Nature with the name of Grace. If this univerſal grace be not natural then it muſt be adventitious or accidental, either acquired, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived or infuſed: If acquired by any art or induſtry of our own, then it becomes particular, and cannot be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, it being originally proportionable in none. If ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, 'tis only in thoſe who ſeek after and take pains to purchaſe it, which certainly whole mankind doth not, if not acquired then it may be derived: but it muſt either be ſo from our Parents, and ſo from <hi>Adam</hi> the firſt Parent;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41737:73"/>but if from <hi>Adam</hi> 'tis nature and not grace, or if not from <hi>Adam,</hi> then if from any 'tis derived from Chriſt and from his Spirit the ſpring of all graces, but they derive grace only to their believing and living Members, not generally to all Men, and this not by immediate inſpiration from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but by the word and means of grace which are neither common nor effectual to all. But if they ſay this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal grace is infuſed by a divine immediate influence, let us have ſome Scripture to prove it, or elſe no body muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, but as there is no word for it, let them ſhew when and how this is done? This univerſal ſufficient grace of <hi>Arminians</hi> is the <hi>Quakers inward light</hi> and the <hi>reaſon</hi> of <hi>Socinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to forge an univerſal ſufficient grace without a power of doing good, without Chriſt and without God, without a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> by the word of God, as without heart to underſtand, eyes to ſee, without a faculty to know the myſteries of the Kingdom of Heaven, and without knowledge and ſence of our miſery, is to ſet up a defficient not a ſufficient grace: That cannot be called ſufficient to act, which hath not every thing neceſſary to acting; and that Cauſe which hath all things neceſſary to act muſt needs produce its effect, for in vain is that Power to act, which doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver act, ſo that pretended grace ſuppoſed to be ſufficient to convert a Man, and bring him into the way of eternal life, and yet never doth it, is but an inſufficient power and an imaginary grace. They would have Chriſt to have made God reconcileable to mankind, procured a poſſibility, which not being reduced to an act ſignifieth nothing, and derogateth from the power and efficacy of his death; for he hath by his death made a real and perfect reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all thoſe he dyed for, he actually reconciled them to his Father, and all they and none elſe ſhall be ſaved.</p>
               <p>They would ground their opinion upon what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith of the Gentiles.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 1.10.</note>

               <p>AND now we are upon this, let us view another branch of this univerſal grace, for they ſay God according to his Decree doth univerſally call all Men, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates as well as Elect, to receive and believe in Chriſt, and this by the means of the word preached to every Man: What we already ſaid may alſo ſerve in anſwer to this; namely, that before and after the coming of Chriſt, millions of Men are dead, who never heard Chriſt preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, yet we may charitably believe that God ſhewed ſome of them mercy; for though they were deprived of the outward ordinary means, God who is not tyed to ſecond cauſes, might by the inward call of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit have revealed unto ſome of them his ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. We may ſay of this Ordinance of the Word, as is ſaid of Baptiſm, which is another:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Mark 16.16.</note> 
                  <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> He doth not ſay, and <hi>is not baptized</hi> ſhall be damned; ſo he that heareth the outward preaching and believeth ſhall be ſaved, we may ſay that though the outward hearhing of the word be the uſual means to breed Faith, yet he that wants it may be taught inwardly, and believe and be ſaved. However things be, thoſe are ſecrets of God which we ought not to dive into. Our Bleſſed Saviour is poſitive againſt univerſal calling, when he ſaith,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Matth. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>many are called,</hi> he doth not ſay all, but many, we may ſay very many or the greateſt part are not called; for as we ſee he comes to nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower bounds, if <hi>few be choſen,</hi> many are called, ſo by a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation we may ſay, if many be called, more are not called. Indeed <hi>David</hi> ſaith<note n="(c)" place="margin">Pſal. 47.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Let all the earth fear
<pb facs="tcp:41737:74"/>the Lord, let all the inhabitants of the world ſtand in are</hi> and <hi>O clap your hands all ye people: ſhout unto God with the voice of triumph.</hi> But this is no ſuch an univerſal vocation to all the Inhabitants of the World as the queſtion is about: all the earth, beſides the reaſon of ſaving grace, hath cauſe enough to fear the Lord and to praiſe him: All the world could not hear what <hi>David</hi> ſaid and did write; but the queſtion is to have Chriſt offered to every Man in the Goſpel, by the miniſtery of Men.</p>
               <p>This leadeth us to another queſtion between <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> and us; namely, ſuppoſing every Man in the world had been called by the preaching of the word, yet it doth not follow, they ſhould have been converted and ſaved without God's ſpecial ſaving grace, becauſe <hi>in Adam men loſt the power of believing the Goſpel.</hi> This queſtion, theſe innovators ſtarted up to ſhow how God is bound to give every Man a ſufficient grace to believe in Chriſt if they will. So they ſay the grace of believing in Chriſt was not given to <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore he could not loſe it, and ſo God may no juſtly require of Man faith to believe in Chriſt, except he giveth him ſufficient grace to believe: But we ſay, God gave <hi>Adam</hi> that grace, and he loſt it: For whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> received from God for himſelf and Poſterity, that ſame through his fall, he loſt for himſelf and Poſterity too; now that with other privileges he received alſo the power of believing the Goſpel, it appeareth, for he received for himſelf and Poſterity the power of loving God and believing his word, whatſoever it might be in time to come, this is proved becauſe without this power the image of God had not been perfect in him, neither had he been, without it, provided with a ſufficient grace to avoid all manner of Infidelity: In the ſtate of innocency God might have revealed him future things, and in caſe of a fall, have promiſed him a gracious reſtoration by the means of his Son. Who can deny but that Men in the ſtate of Innocence might and ought to have believed ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God.</p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:41737:75"/>
               <p>Let us hear what they ſay for themſelves. <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocency ſtood in no need of Faith in Chriſt, therefore God gave him not power to believe in Chriſt; but though in the ſtate of innocency he had no need of Faith, it doth not follow but that God might give it to him; ſtrength and power is not always given to nature for uſe, but ſometimes for perfection: In this ſence 'tis ſaid,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 3.9.</note> 
                  <hi>God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up Children to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi> Yet there is no need of doing it; God had given <hi>Adam</hi> ſtrength to travel all the world over, which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did; neither was there any occaſion for him to do it. Again they object, God gave <hi>Adam</hi> the Law, therefore he was not bound to believe in Chriſt, becauſe Faith is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Law, but though the Law was given unto <hi>Adam,</hi> yet he was bound to believe in Chriſt, for although Faith be not expreſly commanded in the Law, yet 'tis impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly, becauſe by the Law a Man is bound to believe every word of God which in time to come ſhould be revealed unto him.</p>
               <p>We have already ſhewed there is no ſuch univerſal voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they are for: However it is granted ſeveral Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates have an outward calling, but ſeeing they are not converted, the queſtion is put, <hi>to what purpoſe, and for what end are reprobates thus called?</hi> Our Adverſaries ſay, 'tis to the end they ſhould be made partakers of everlaſting life. This we cannot agree to, becauſe they do not attain to it. Whence neceſſarily followeth, that (as I ſaid hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) God is fruſtrated of his end, which is a ſign and ef<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fect of want of Power and Wiſdom; which muſt needs be ſo, if in what God doth, he propoſeth to himſelf an end which he foreknoweth he cannot and ſhall not attain unto, no Man of ſound mind will do ſo, and of God it cannot be affirmed without blaſphemy. This conſideration is ſo pregnant that they think to ſhift it off with a diſtinction; God doth not abſolute, ſay they, intend they ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but upon condition they ſhall obey and come in at the call, and perſevere therein: now this condition not being performed by Reprobates, they ſay, God is not diſappointed of his end: but what a pitiful coming off is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41737:75"/>this, ſhall a Man not deprived of his wits, make an end, which he in earneſt aimeth at, depend upon a condition which he is ſure ſhall never be. God foreſeeth Reprobates will not obey the call, much leſs continue in obedience. I farther ſay, no Man who hath his wits will make an end which in earneſt he propoſeth to himſelf, depend upon ſuch means, as none but himſelf can procure, and which he is reſolved never to procure: But to incline to obedience the hearts of thoſe that are called, and to turn ſtony hearts into hearts of fleſh, none can do't but God alone; but experience teaches he will not do it in Reprobates, a ſign he hath decreed not to do it. And let the nonſence of their Hypotheſis and Aſſertion be taken notice of, which is thus. <hi>God in calling reprobates intends to ſave them, in caſe he giveth them effectual grace to obey the call, which he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved never to do.</hi> God doth not intend the effectual calling or converſion of every one whom the Goſpel is preached to, and have only the outward means of Salvation, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearet out of the fore-quoted places.<note place="margin">Ezech. 2.5.</note> For ſometimes a Prophet ſent to a people or to a perſon, is a ſtumbling block to that people or perſon; ſo of ſome other Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.<note place="margin">John 15.22.</note> And this is God's own doing for he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ezech. 3.20.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 24.14.</note> not with an intention in God to convert the whole world, for then God would be diſapointed of his purpoſe. For Scripture and Experience teach us the contrary, that all ſhall not anſwer the call and be converted: In the Text the Lord Jeſus declares, why the Goſpel ſhall be preached in all the world, <hi>for a witneſs unto all nations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the laſt day, ſhall be the general Aſſize, where every Man ſhall be called to an account for his ſins; the Cauſes ſhall not be between Man and Man, but between God and Man, and the Lord Jeſus ſhall be the viſible Judge, for by him God will judge the World: Now as matters of fact do require proof by Evidences, ſo God makes ſure of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to convince and confound the wicked, for as St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſaid, to thoſe of <hi>Lyſtra, God left not himſelf without witneſs, in that he did good, and gave us rain and fruitful ſeaſons.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 14.17.</note> Theſe mercies though common will be Evidences againſt thoſe that abuſed or remained unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful under them. So ſhall the outward means and offers of grace againſt thoſe that neglected and rejected them, though God never intended they ſhould thereby be converted, for God's ſecret will was unknown to them, and the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ought to have obeyed, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Sacrifice his Son, ſo ought all when command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to repent and believe. Now thoſe witneſſes of God are of two ſorts: Firſt, thoſe that are of his own immediate appointment, as were the Lord's Diſciples, to whom he
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:41737:77"/>ſaid,<note place="margin">John 15.27.</note> 
                  <hi>ye alſo ſhall bear me witneſs, becauſe ye have been with me from the beginning,</hi> which he repeated after his Reſurrection, <hi>Ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me both in Jeruſalem, and in all Judea and Samaria:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 1.8. &amp; 13.31.</note> Of whom 'tis ſaid in the ſame Book, who are <hi>his witneſſes,</hi> unto the people.

               <p>The ſecond ſort of witneſſes are from or within men themſelves that are guilty. Wherefore ſaith our Saviour to the <hi>Jews, ye be witneſſes unto your ſelves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 23.31.</note> And with the Gentiles, <hi>their conſcience alſo bearing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.15, 16.</note> and ſhall bear, <hi>witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing or elſe excuſing one another.</hi> I a word, God can never want witneſſes, for if theſe held their peace, ſaith Chriſt, the very ſtones would ſpeak, and be witneſſes according to what <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>This ſtone ſhall be a witneſs.</hi> Thus to our preſent purpoſe God doth outwardly call re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and commands them to repent, not with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent they ſhould do ſo, for he denys them the grace of repentance and faith, without which they cannot repent and believe: For if God would effectually have it ſo, it ſhould infallibly be according to what we have in a place of the prayer book. <hi>Whoſe power no creature is able to reſiſt,</hi> grounded on St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>who hath reſiſted his will:</hi> But God doth it to ſhew them their duty and leave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, ſeeing they had Chriſt offered to them. Here they object a place I anſwered before about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but becauſe they lay a ſtreſs upon the compariſon, as the Hen gathereth her Chickens, a ſign, ſay they, that Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their Salvation; to what I ſaid I ſhall add, that Chriſt doth uſe the compariſon of his being willing to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as a Hen gathereth her Chickens,<note place="margin">Matth. 23.27.</note> not in relation to the end and intention, but as to the effect if their affection had been anſwerable. They ſay farther, if when Chriſt calleth Reprobates to come to him, he doth not intend thereby to ſave them, then the outward voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth differ from his inward purpoſe, which we deny. For by the outward calling God actually doth with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:41737:77"/>what in the call he propoſed within himſelf, for God purpoſed to call reprobates, to promiſe them Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation upon account of Obedience; to the end they ſhould learn the way to Salvation, to know their Duty and at laſt confeſs they are juſtly Damned, and he obtaineth the end he aimed at. But here followeth a high charge. God promiſing Salvation to reprobates upon an impoſſible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which he is not willing to give them grace to perform, doth but mock and deceive them. We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the promiſe of Salvation made to reprobates upon an impoſſible condition, is no deluſion, but a denyal of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for want of performance of the condition, without which no Man can be ſaved even according to God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; for as in time God denyeth reprobates Salvation by reaſon of impenitency, ſo from eternity he decreed to damn them for impenitency, the end of the Promiſe and of the Vocation are the ſame. When <hi>God commandeth all men every where to repent,</hi> 'tis not meant the end of the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; as if it was God's purpoſe it ſhould be ſo, but 'tis the thing commanded, and which thoſe who are called ought to do. We muſt in this matter have a care not to confound the intention of the Miniſter with that of God, who from eternity knows every individual reprobate, the Miniſter not ſo, for being not able to know reprobates from the elect, he muſt have a real intention in his ſtation to ſave every one that heareth him, and if he be miſtaken and diſappointed of his end, he being neither All-mighty, nor All-knowing, there is no abſurdity therein; but here we ſpeak of the end of the vocation of reprobates in relation to God.</p>
               <p>Two things more I am to anſwer. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God is not an hypocrite, though he doth not intend the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all thoſe whom he calleth to't, an hypocrite would ſeem to be what he is not, but there is no ſuch intention in God, only he points at and ſheweth reprobates the cauſe why he denyeth them Salvation. The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing I am now to do is to ſhew that God in his outwardly calling of reprobates is not unjuſt, though he requireth of them impoſſible things: But before, I muſt anſwer an Objection I
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:41737:78"/>had omitted, to ſhew that 'tis in Man's power to ſave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if he will, 'tis taken out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Philip. 2.12, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling:</hi> But this goeth from the ſtate of the queſtion, which is about Converſion before it be effected, but in this place the Apoſtle ſpeaks to regenarated Men, for he ſaith, <hi>they always obeyed;</hi> now as in the act of Converſion we are meerly Paſſive, after it is effected, and there is the new Man created in us, we are not like Stone and Stocks, we move as we are acted by the ſpirit of God. This is an Exhortation to Holineſs and every good Work, but to ſhew how the Apoſtle doth not think it is in their power to work their own Salvation of themſelves, in the next verſe, he addeth, <hi>For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:</hi> This explantation he giveth, for fear they ſhould miſunderſtand what he ſaid about working their Salvation, and we ſee how to keep them from Pride and Preſumption, he ſaith, work it <hi>with fear and trembling.</hi> But now I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn where I left, and ſay, of things unpoſſible, ſome are ſo, abſolutely and of their nature, others are ſuch only in ſome reſpect and accident, that obedience which God requireth of Men, is not of abſolute impoſſibility, for if there was any injuſtice in the caſe, here it would lay, but what God requires of Men was once poſſible, but man through his own fault loſt that power, what in the ſtate of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency (namely obedience) was poſſible for Man, is by his fall become unpoſſible to him, yet for all this, he ſtill is bound to do his Duty, the more becauſe he hath no excuſe to plead for in relation to God, who neither inticed him, nor commanded or compelled him, but rather expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with threatnings did forbid him to ſin, ſo that God is moſt juſt in calling for his own. This is as if a Man had lent me Money, when it was lent I was able to pay, but ſince through my own ill management I ruined my whole Eſtate, and made it unpoſſible for me to pay the Debt, muſt my Creditor ſuffer for my evil Courſes, after I am become a prodigal Son? Is he unjuſt to call for his Money, and make me pay the Debt? No ſurely, as you ſee the<note n="(b)" place="margin">Matth. 18. from 24. to 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord did by that ſervant of his, who had no mercy upon his fellow ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:41737:78"/>for though it was unpoſſible for him to pay the ten thouſand talents, yet <hi>he delivered him to the Tormentors,</hi> till he ſhould pay all that was due, that is for-ever, for he could never do't; here the torments of Hell are meant, ſo God may juſtly do with every Man, whom he hath no mind to be merciful to. I do add one thing more, how the Law promiſed life upon unpoſſible conditions of a mans own perfect obedience; yet we do not read that any of the <hi>Jews</hi> ever ſaid the Law was unjuſt, on the contrary we find <hi>the Law</hi> was confeſſed to be <hi>holy juſt and good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.12.</note> and let ſome men ſay what they will, we all know and muſt own, that faith the condition upon which eternal life is promiſed in the Goſpel is unpoſſible for men, becauſe 'tis <hi>a gift of God.</hi> Let therefore God be owned to be juſt in all his ways,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.12.</note> though <hi>all may be damned who believe not the truth:</hi> God ſent them ſtrong deluſions to believe a lye, <hi>that they might be damned,</hi> as if he had ſaid that there might be a juſt cauſe of their damnation.</p>

This I inſiſt the more upon, to make this temporal Faith better known and how far it bordereth upon true faith, becauſe our Adverſaries do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found it with the true faith, which is the fourth kind of Faith.</p>
               <p>This is the only true faith otherwiſe called ſaving and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:41737:79"/>juſtifying faith, which doth conſiſt not only in knowledge of things neceſſary to Salvation, and alſo in an aſſent to all truths revealed in Gods word which reprobates may have, but alſo in a truſt and confidence and relying upon Chriſt and in a ſpecial way applying unto the Soul the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral promiſes of God, without this there is no true faith, and here we are to do two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſhew the difference between temporal and juſtifying faith, and then prove that aſſurance is eſſential to true faith without which it cannot be ſuch: As to the <hi>firſt,</hi> ſaving faith is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a real ſpiritual joy, not ariſing out of any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſideration, but only out of the ſence of God's mercy; this, temporal faith hath not, nor the following ſigns of ſaving faith. <hi>Secondly,</hi> True faith hath a love of Chriſt overcoming all difficulties, which love is attended with a religious fear of offending God; and with a ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how to promote his glory. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A ſence of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs amidſt the greateſt troubles and calamities. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A hope of glory which maketh not aſhamed, raiſed within us by the ſpirit,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note> 
                  <hi>which beareth witneſs with our ſpirit, that we are the children of God.</hi> Laſtly, A ſpecial unmoveable truſt and confidence in the mercy of God, and an application of Chriſt's merits. Temporal faith hath nothing to do with theſe, but they are proper to true ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith. Hence may appear, the error of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, or rather of the truth, who would have temporal and ſaving faith to be the ſame in nature, and to differ only as to duration of time.</p>
               <p>Now as to the other thing, that a truſt and confidence in God is of the nature of faith, it doth appear from the names given faith in the word of God. 'Tis called boldneſs and confidence.<note n="(b)" place="margin">

Let this be obſerved, that when in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture faith is attributed to reprobates, 'tis not meant true ſaving faith, which they never had, but only hiſtorical or temporal, an outward and hyp critical proſeſſion of faith, or of the doctrine of the Goſpel, and this calls to my mind that place of Scripture about the parable of the talents, the talent was taken from the man, when 'tis ſaid,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 25.29.</note> 
                  <hi>from him that hath not ſhall be taken away, even that which he hath.</hi> How can that man have that which he hath not, or that be taken away which he hath not: The matter is explained by another Evangeliſt thus,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Luke 8.11.</note> 
                  <hi>whoſoever hath not ſhall be taken away even that which he ſeemeth to have,</hi> he had it in appearance, but not in reallity, ſo reprobates have faith but in a ſhew, and when they have loſt it, 'tis only that which they ſeemed to have, but never had it really.

I ſay, Election is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by effectual calling, by Faith and Repentance, ſo is Faith by the fruits and effects thereof, as are good works, as certainly-as one may conclude where a fire is there is heat, and when the Sun ſhineth, it is day-light: Thus the cauſe is proved by the effect, and the effect by the cauſe. Where is motion either natural or ſpiritual, we may confidently aſſirm there is life accordingly. Thus we need not to go up to Heaven to dive into the ſecret Council of God; nor to turn the leaves of the Book of Life, to ſee whether our names be written in it, but to ſearch into our own ſouls and examine our own Thoughts, Affections and Actings, if there be holineſs, love and other fruits of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Now they object, that this certitude muſt be expreſſed or implyed in the word, and thence drawen by a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but we ſay, it doth not ariſe out of the letter of the word, but out of the inward teſtimony of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding being enlightened by the holy Ghoſt, which beareth witneſs to our ſpirit that we are the Children of God, and conſequently that we have true faith: This is not written in the Book of Scripture, but in the Book of our Heart with the very finger of the Holy Ghoſt; hence it is that we do not believe we do believe, but we feel and perceive it, as we do not believe we think of God when we do't, but we know and feel it in our minds. One thing here I muſt take notice of upon the matter, in relation to that Exhertation of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> to examine themſelves; that it is a great deal of pity that many (I dare ſay good people) do not ſet themſelves upon that tryal, but do either wholly or in part neglect it, but if they be of God's Elect, at one time or other they muſt come to't, the ſooner the better, and the more often to known what progreſs they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:41737:82"/>made in faith, what degrees of ſtrength it hath gotten; and for neglecting this ſo neceſſary a duty, they thereby deprive themſelves of much comfort which would accrue to them. To make an end of this matter, I ſhall add that this certitude is very much improved, when we can clearly make out we have an intereſt in Chriſt, and are Chriſt's: For ſaith the Apoſtle,<note n="(a)" place="margin">1 Cor. 3.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye are Chriſt's, and Chriſt is God's.</hi> To know whether we be Chriſt's, we have a certain rule to know it by; that is, if the ſpirit of Chriſt be in us:<note n="(b)" place="margin">Rom. 8.9.</note> For if <hi>any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt he is none of his.</hi> How then to know whether the ſpirit be in us?

How few of the great multitudes he taught were conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him? So that we muſt not ſeek in the diſpenſers of the word for the cauſe, why ſome believe and others do not. The cauſe why all do not believe, is not, as the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries would have it, becauſe they do not all they can, and do not make uſe of all the power remaining in them out of their natural corruption, that they do not go to Church, do not hear, nor read the word as often as they ought; that the ſpirit of God is ever ready to give faith to all that do theſe things, which is moſt falſe, for though we own men are in the wrong to neglect thoſe Chriſtian duties; yet though they would perform, all that and more, it would not do, for God giveth faith to none but to thoſe whom from eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he decreed to give it to: How could God have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, by the word to give faith unto every man? when as experience ſheweth, and we already have proved it, he doth not afford every man that outward call. We own that uſually God doth not give men come to years faith without hearing or reading of the word; but Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and experience do teach, God doth not give it to every one that heareth and readeth it; ſo that 'tis falſe to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41737:83"/>ſay the neglect of the word is the only cauſe, why God gives not every one faith; for ſeveral do read, hear, meditate, preach and write Commentaries upon the Word, who yet never have true faith. Yet we own how God bleſſeth the Miniſtery of ſome more than of others.</p>
               <p>Now to come to the true cauſe of it, 'tis becauſe God hath decreed to give it only to the Elect, for faith is an effect of our Election:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Acts. 13.48.</note>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Chriſt dyed not for All.</head>
               <p>WE are now come to another Point, about the extent of our Saviours death: This is a matter of very great importance, both in it ſelf, and in the conſequence thereof; and becauſe the deciding of a queſtion doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times much depend upon the right ſtating of it. I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour ſo to do in this, in order to it in few words, I here lay down what Papiſts and <hi>Arminians</hi> ſay, 'tis thus: They teach that Chriſt by his death intended the univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of all and every particular Man, whether Elect or Reprobate without diſtinction, that by his death he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually obtained for all, the grace and favour of God. That the application of theſe graces thus obtained, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth only on the free-will of Man; ſome according to their liberty making uſe of that purchaſed gift, others to whom that Grace and Salvation was alike purchaſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on God's part, do by their own contempt and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect according to the ſame liberty of their will, reject it. But we ſay that the Lord Jeſus did not give his Blood and Life for all, only for the Elect, his Members, and that by his death, he hath ſatisfied Gods Juſtice, only for thoſe who get good by it, that is all Believers before his death, in the time of or after his death, to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Treatiſe, I made uſe of a kind of argument, which here I ſhall not repeat, only ſay that Scripture reduces it to <hi>many:</hi> and who are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the <hi>many,</hi> I inſtanced out of ſeveral Texts of Scripture. Now we proceed to other proofs, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue thus: He who will not do the leaſt thing for one, will not do the greateſt for him. He who will not ſpeak a good
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:41737:85"/>word for a man, ſurely will not dye for that man; but our Saviour would not pray for the world, for Reprobates, therefore he would not dye for Reprobates. Our Saviour is plain upon this,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 17.</note> in that Prayer of his, which makes up a whole Chapter, juſt before he was taken, where after he had prayed for himſelf, he prayed alſo for them whom the Father had given him out of the world, for his Elect and Believers. He ſolemnly declares he excludeth the wicked from his Prayer.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Verſ 9.</note> 
                  <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world,</hi> but <hi>for them which thou haſt given me out of the world:</hi> This he ſaith, (if I may ſo ſay) upon his death bed, when he was about going to dye, 'tis as good as if he had ſaid, I dye not for the <hi>world,</hi> the world of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, for that's the ſignification of the word in that place, as anon by the grace of God we ſhall make it appear.</p>
               <p>Again, thoſe for whom Chriſt dyed, he loved ſo as that he could love them no more for he ſaith himſelf,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Joh. 15.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends:</hi> But it cannot be ſaid that Chriſt loved Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, ſo, that he could love them no more, therefore he dyed not for them. I ſay farther, ſurely Chriſt would not dye for thoſe whom he will never own nor ſuffer to come near him: but he ſaith, and we ought to believe him, how at the laſt day,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Matth. 7.23.</note> 
                  <hi>He will profeſs unto them, I never knew you: Depart from me ye that work iniquity.</hi> 'Tis not to be ſuppoſed he would dye for thoſe whom he will uſe ſo at laſt; as to deny he ever knew them, with that knowledge which is joyned with ſpecial love and favour. Farthermore,<note n="(e)" place="margin">Rom. 5.10</note> 
                  <hi>They for whom Chriſt dyed were reconciled to God by his death, and being reconciled ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> But it cannot be ſaid that Reprobates were reconciled to God, or ſhall be ſaved; therefore Chriſt dyed not for them: Now, ſins are not imputed to thoſe who thorough Chriſt's death are reconciled to God, but ſins are imputed to all that are damned, wherefore none of thoſe that are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned were reconciled to God by the death of his Son. The major or firſt part of our argument is grounded upon Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note n="(f)" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.19.</note> 
                  <hi>God was in Chriſt, reconciling the world to himſelf,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:41737:85"/>not imputing their ſins unto them.</hi> Neither doth the Lord Jeſus as we ſaid before, cauſe his death to be preached to all; for 'tis ſaid in relation to this,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Gentiles were without Chriſt, aliens from the common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers from the covenants of promiſe, having no hope, and without God in the world.</hi> If ſo, then certainly he dyed not for all, if his death was not publiſhed to all, and it was not to thoſe that were without Chriſt; and there can be no benefit by Chriſt's death for men come to age except that death be preached; but it is much leſs and more eaſie to have a death preached to one, than to die for him. Laſtly, I ſay if Chriſt be dead for all and every man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception; then he dyed for thoſe that were in Hell long before his death, and to whom he knew his death would do no good: And do we take that precious Blood of the Covenant to be ſo ſlight a thing as to be ſhed in vain, for thoſe who could not be the better for it? Nay, for<note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 10.20.</note> 
                  <hi>thoſe who had trodden,</hi> or ſhould tread, <hi>under foot the Son of God, and count the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing.</hi> This were too much to prophane it, that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blood ſhould be ſhed for <hi>Judas,</hi> who, as our Saviour ſaid,<note n="(c)" place="margin">John. 6.70.</note> was <hi>a devil,</hi>
                  <note n="(d)" place="margin">John. 17.12.</note>

                  <hi>Woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed, it had been good for that man if he had not been born:</hi> Chriſt then had dyed in vain, if for thoſe that were in Hell, out of which there is no redemption, and this with an intent to procure them Salvation. What an Opinion is this? How injurious to the wiſdom of Chriſt? So the word <hi>all</hi> is to be reſtrained, as when <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 3.26. of Chriſt, <hi>all</hi> men come to him, ſurely not every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual man.</p>
               <p>All the Arguments whereby they endeavour to oppoſe this Dectrine, may be reduced under two Heads, for they lay a ſtreſs chiefly upon two words in Scripture, the firſt is the word <hi>world,</hi> the other the word <hi>all:</hi> Under the firſt come in ſeveral Texts of Holy Scripture, as theſe,<note n="(f)" place="margin">John 1.29.</note>

               <p>Now after this it is eaſie to anſwer their Objections out of the fore-quoted Texts of Scripture, for in them by <hi>all</hi> are not underſtood all and every ſingular man whether Elect or Reprobate; but only the Elect diſperſed all the world over, who at laſt receive the gift of Faith, and through the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, are ſaved. And I hope this is made clear enough to any who impartially deſireth to be informed of the truth. However, becauſe they lay a great ſtreſs upon that place of 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. I ſhall now ſay in particular ſomething to't, we already have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how there is a world of Believers taken out of the general world, who by theſe means is divided into the world of Believers and of Reprobates: hence it is that our Saviour ſaith,<note n="(a)" place="margin">John. 15.19.</note> 
                  <hi>I have choſen you out of the world.</hi> And this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of choſen men though comparatively ſmall as to the wicked world, yet it is great enough to deſerve the name of world which is a Scripture phraſe reſtrictive as we read it in the Goſpel.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Luke. 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>There went out a decree from Caeſar Auguſtus, that all the world ſhould be taxed:</hi> Not every part and corner of the world, for many either never heard of or had any thing to do with the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> ſaid of our Saviour, <hi>Behold the world is gone after him!</hi> 'Twas but a very ſmall part of the Jewiſh world. Thus in this place of St. <hi>John</hi> is to be taken,<note place="margin">John. 12.19.</note> the word <hi>the whole world,</hi> as in the other, <hi>all the world.</hi> The Church, which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by meant, is a world by it ſelf: Hence it is called <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> or Univerſal, having a King and Laws by herſelf; but becauſe this would engage me too far, I turn again ſhort upon our Text, whereof the words confirm what we ſay; for 'tis ſaid, that Chriſt is the Advocate and the Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only for the ſins of the Believers he writes to, for the word <hi>our</hi> ſins imports thus much, but alſo for that whole world of Believers, for Chriſt may not be called the Advocate and Propitiation for the wicked: So that if the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> be equally Advocate of Elect and Reprobates, and Propitiation for the ſins of both ſorts, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that either the Elect ſhall be damned or the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates ſaved, for all whom Chriſt hath undertaken for, ſhall certainly be ſaved, ſo that in conſequence of this opinion
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41737:87"/>there ſhall be but one place, all Heaven, or all Hell. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Beda,</hi> and other Antient Orthodox Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors give the ſame interpretation of the place, as we do, by the whole world of Believers.</p>
               <p>Now I come to the other branch of their objection, which runs upon the word <hi>all,</hi> but before I give a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular anſwer to the ſeveral places of Scripture to prove that Chriſt died for all, I muſt ſay ſomething in general towards the clearing of the point: No man can deny but divers Scriptures which are conceived in univerſal terms muſt be expounded with reſtrictions, as when 'tis ſaid, <hi>They ſhall all be taught of God.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:41737:89"/>Brother with eating things which he thinks to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful and unclean; neither is one deſtroyed upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of offence, though his Conſcience be thereby wounded, for the hand of God doth uphold thoſe whom his Son hath redeemed. Of this ſame nature is another place they bring againſt us.<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Some deny the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction.</hi> But this Text is not about true redemption from eternal death, but only a deliverance of the error and ignorance of the times, by the means of the light of the Goſpel, which happeneth ſometimes to the falſe Prophets which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, not that they were ſo in truth, but only in appearance, they lived in the Church with them that were truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed whoſe number they ſeemed to be of, but were not really ſo.</p>
               <p>I now come to the laſt Objection, which is that all to whom Chriſt's death is preached are bound to believe Chriſt died for them, or elſe they would be bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lye; but, as many Reprobates are hearers of the Word, ſo they ought to believe that Chriſt died for them: But 'tis not true that all thoſe whom the word is preached to, ought abſolutely to believe Chriſt died effectually for their ſins; but only in a qualified and reſtrictive ſence, if God enableth them by his grace to repent and believe, not that repentance ſhould be the cauſe of that death of his; but a moſt certain and infallible ſign of it, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth indeed bind all the Faithful and Elect to believe that Chriſt effectually died for them, becauſe it is ſo; but for thoſe who are yet out of Chriſt there is no ſuch Precept, they muſt firſt really be ingrafted in Chriſt, and then believe it, not firſt believe it, and then be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted, elſe they ſhould believe a lye in believing their ſins are actually purged; becauſe a Man muſt be firſt in Chriſt before his iniquity can actually be waſhed away. Then Scriptures enjoyn no reprobate and unregenerate Man to believe at firſt that Chriſt effectually died for his ſins, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I ſaid upon condition of Repentance and Faith, which the reprobate ſhall never have, and the unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate who is Elect, is not abſolutely bound to believe it,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:41737:90"/>till the time of his converſion be come. And ſuppoſe every private Man were obliged to believe Chriſt effectually died for his ſins; yet it doth not follow therefore that Chriſt died effectually for all Men, becauſe knowing nothing to the contrary, every Man may be bound particularly to believe for himſelf, but not for all beſides, 'tis not well argued to ſay, every Man muſt particularly believe he is Elected, therefore he muſt believe all are Elected, or he muſt believe particularly he ſhall be ſaved, therefore he muſt believe all ſhall be ſaved; this Argument from the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual to the ſpecies doth not hold: The revealed will of God obligeth Man to believe ſuch things as God in his ſecret will never intended to accompliſh. So <hi>Abraham</hi> was bound to believe, as alſo he believed it, that God ſurely intended the Sacrificing of his Son, becauſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to do it. Yet God intended to try his Faith; <hi>The Ninevites</hi> were bound to believe and ſo they did, the Prediction of <hi>Jonah.</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">Joh. 3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Yet forty days and Nineveh ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed;</hi> yet God intended their repentance not their ruine.</p>
               <p>It is a miſtake to think that every one whom Chriſt is preached unto, is bound to believe that he died for him, which not being he is bound to believe a lye, which to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the better, one muſt know the ſeveral degrees of Faith in this caſe. Upon hearing the Goſpel preached, there is a general Faith required, namely, that the Lord Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners; the next thing for a Man to believe is, that if I repent and believe, Chriſt came into the world to ſave me; ſo this is but conditional and many a wicked Man can believe thus far, but the third and laſt degree is proper only to the Elect, and 'tis this, when upon ſelf examination and inquiry, a Man finds that he repents; as thus, formerly I delighted in ſin, now I hate it, heretofore I did eagerly run after the occaſions, now I avoid them, and alſo doth find and feel that he believeth, thus I know and am ſenſible of the deſperate condition I am in by nature, and ſee there is but one way to come out of it, namely, through the Lord Jeſus, for there is no Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in any other, wherefore I hope and truſt for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in him, I lay hold upon and believe in him, and do
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:41737:90"/>feel within me a comfort and inward aſſurance in the holy Ghoſt whereby I am ſealed, and which is the earneſt of the Inheritance, and aſſures me that I am the child of God. Now a Man in ſuch a condition is bound to believe that Chriſt died for him, and believes it, and ſo believes the truth; according to this method, St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Tim. 1.15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief; how be it, for this cauſe I obtained mercy.</hi> Ye ſee he hath the general notion wherefore Chriſt came into the world, then he proceeds to apply it unto himſelf: Laſtly, he is ſure and believeth he obtained mercy: This is the caſe of every Elect and Believer, for there is for all but one way to Salvation.</p>
               <p>Some go another way to work, and ſay, all are bound to believe Chriſt dyed not effectually, but <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for all, if thereby be meant that the death of Chriſt as to the value and Merit, be ſufficient to ſave all, we agree to it, for if there had been ten thouſand worlds, Chriſt's death had been a ſufficient value and price to ſave all; but that diſtinction of <hi>effectually</hi> for the Elect and <hi>ſufficiently</hi> for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, doth not well become the dignity and merits of Chriſt's death, wherein the deſign and wiſdom of God and Chriſt are concerned, to dye for one is properly ſo to die on his behalf, as that he thereby may be delivered from death, and this as our Saviour ſaith,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Joh. 15.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Implyeth the greateſt love that can be:</hi> Now to ſay that Chriſt dyed <hi>ſufficiently</hi> not <hi>effectually,</hi> is as good as to ſay, Chriſt out of his infinite love for Reprobates dyed in their ſtead, that they ſhould be ſufficiently delivered from death, but noteffectually, that is, that they ſhould never be actually delivered.</p>
               <p>To ſay that Chriſt dyed for Reprobates, not to the end they ſhould actually be delivered, but only put in a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being ſo, 'tis in a manner to imply (or elſe what they ſay is to no purpoſe) that it lays in their power to receive Chriſt by Faith, ſeeing without it they cannot be ſaved, which all comes to this, that God decreed from Eternity to ſave all and every Man upon condition they ſhall believe, which ſmells of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> and <hi>Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm:</hi> Theſe are a new late ſort of <hi>Arminians,</hi> who would
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:41737:91"/>have minced and mitigated things; but did not God from Eternity foreſee many would not believe, and decreed not to give them Faith, which except he doth, they can never have? Why then ſhould God have made a decree upon a condition, which he knew ſhall never be performed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving decreed never to grant the means to do it? when a wiſe Man will not become guilty of ſo much imprudence. But let this be enough upon the matter which in our hands is ſwelled beyond what we at firſt intended, but 'tis ſo copious that 'tis almoſt unavoidable, and yet how many things more might have been ſaid. Now we will proceed to ſomething elſe.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Pelagius</hi> was their Grand-father, whoſe Errors <hi>Auſtin</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew with Scripture and Reaſon, God at that time having raiſed him up to be Champion for Grace, who in this matter handled the word of God ſo powerfully and like a wiſe Maſter-builder, and in ſo ſucceſsful a way that the unſound Tenets were beaten down, and the upholders thereof highly diſcountenanced: But after <hi>Pelagius</hi> his death his Sectators appeared, but under another ſhape, not altogether ſo hideous, for they did not poſitively deny Original Sin, but ſo had however, that the ſame Doctor took up the Cudgels againſt thoſe <hi>Semipelagians. Arminius</hi> in his days renewed the diſpute on the behalf of the <hi>Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in a time when all the Reformed Churches both here and abroad quietly and without diſturbance taught the truth of all thoſe Doctrines: The truth was then in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pulpits, of Divinity Schools and of Preſſes, but what
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:41737:93"/>when this Man appeared, the moſt Famous and Learned Proteſtant Divines at home and abroad oppoſed him, and did write againſt him: If any one hath a mind to know the ſhifts and tricks of that Party to ſtrengthen themſelves and undermine their oppoſers, and to prevent the calling of a General Synod which was ſued for as the beſt way effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to maintain truth and oppoſe falſehood, let him read the <hi>Acts of the Synod of Dort,</hi> with the Preface to it, where they had all the fair play that might reaſonably be wiſhed for. But becauſe about theſe matters in the eighth Century, diſputes did break out again, as it appeared in the caſe of <hi>Gotteſcalk,</hi> wherein <hi>Hinemarus</hi> of <hi>Rheims</hi> and <hi>Remigius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons</hi> with the Churches of his Dioceſe were highly engaged; theſe laſt for, and the other againſt <hi>Gotteſcalk,</hi> which if any one deſireth to be well informed of, let him read the Honeſt and Excellent account of it given by that worthy and Eminent Prinate of <hi>Ireland, James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> which I quoted before.</p>
               <p>A thing much to be taken notice of in all theſe diſputes; and which is the chief Subject of this Chapter, is this, that <hi>Arminius</hi> and his Followers do hold the opinions of <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and <hi>Semipelagians;</hi> and that <hi>Calvin,</hi> whom they make the head againſt their opinions, and we, hold the ſame with <hi>Auſtin, Hilarius, Proſper, Fulgentius</hi> and other Orthodox Doctors of the Primitive Church; we hitherto have ſufficiently declared ours; what remaineth is for me to ſhew what thoſe Fathers of the Church did hold about theſe points; but that ſhall be briefly, becauſe the trouble of proving it hath been ſaved me by others, who make good out of the writings of thoſe ancient Fathers, the things now in queſtion.</p>

               <p>I think I have done enough in this kind to prove that in the matters of grace, we have the Doctors of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church with us, and others in ſome of the late Ages; and conſequently <hi>Calvin</hi> is not the Author of ſuch Doctrines, and that we brought no Innovation into the Church, which aſperſion we may juſtly retort upon our Adverſaries. And to ſhew the more that conformity, we have with the antient Catholick Church, I muſt ſay in ſhort, how the very ſame aſperſions by <hi>Arminians</hi> caſt upon us, were by <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his followers laid to the charge of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and they are theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That they take away free-will and bring in a <hi>Stoical</hi> fatality. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the make God the author of ſin. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They open a gap to deſpair and ſlothfulneſs. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all uſe of Precepts, Promiſes, Threatnings; yea and Prayer it ſelf. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That they make God an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor, ſeeing he commands men to repent and believe, yet doth not ſeriouſly will their repentance and faith,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:41737:98"/>nor their Salvation, unto which only faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can entitle them. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That their whole opinions are againſt the ſtream of Antiquity. Theſe were falſely fathered upon the Doctrine of <hi>Auſtin</hi> and other Orthodox Doctors of the Church, as eaſily I now can and upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſhall ever be ready to prove out of their own writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; but this I now omit, not to fill up ſo much Paper with Quotations, neither thinking it ſo material to know what thoſe Fathers believed, as what the word of God which we have not been wanting to make uſe of, doth declare upon the matter. Nay, to go up higher, I have ſhewed how it was againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine objected,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> and the Objections by him anſwered of making God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and men excuſable, out of the neceſſity of God's Decree; and as theſe were falſly fathered upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, afterwards on <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Doctrine: So with the very ſame, the truths we teach are aſperſed by our Adverſaries, who are men of the ſame Principles as the others were.

               <p>AFter they have done their worſt againſt us; they muſt now give us leave to retort upon them, but on much better and truer grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Their Doctrine of Predeſtination doth quite over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the Eternal and Unchangeable decree of God, about Election and Reprobation; for if every man may believe, repent and be ſaved if he will himſelf, then it unavoidably followeth that every man is left unto himſelf without the bounds of any decree ſet unto him; then there can be no eternal, immutable, poſitive decree binding either way, Election or Reprobation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It makes the unconſtant will of man the ground, of all God's Eternal and Unchangeable Decrees concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man: Whereas God only<note n="(a)" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.11.</note> 
                  <hi>works all things after the counſel of his own will,</hi> not according to the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of our will, whereby God is ſubordinated to man, and his will made to depend upon the will of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This makes the Creature Abſolute, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Soveraign diſpoſing and over-ruling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Maker, and makes God a bare Spectator, not an orderer of humane Actions. Hereupon God muſt wait upon Men and not Men upon God, ſo God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all diſpoſing Power and over-ruling the wills and works of men: His abſolute Supremacy over them to ſave or not, will be aboliſhed; thus men may ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:41737:99"/>when God will damn, and damn themſelves when God would ſave: This is to conſtitute an abſolute inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent eternal Being in the wills of men pre-exiſtent to the eternal will of God, both in Nature and Time, for if the fore-knowledge and Decrees, do reſult from the will and inclinations of men, then man's inclination and will, doth neceſſitate and predetermine the moſt abſolute and moſt free Decrees of God, and raiſeth a ſelf dependence, which is to make a god of the will of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It takes away from God the Praiſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his grace, for if every man may thus convert and ſave himſelf becauſe according to them, thoſe only are ſaved who take care to improve the general common grace derived equally upon all men; what thanks to God then for any ſpecial favour, man may thank himſelf not God who doth no farther ſave him than he ſaveth himſelf. This indeed deſtroyeth the nature of the grace of God, in that it doth indifferently communicate it to all. Hence Election, Vocation, Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctification, Faith, Converſion, Repentance, Charity are called graces, becauſe beſtowed upon few, and that without any merit of the perſon. Thus when a Prince beſtoweth freely a Place, an Office, a Penſion upon a man, it is grace and favour, becauſe not beſtowed upon all or upon ſome other man; far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this maketh Grace and Heaven a purchaſe of our own, and not a free gift of God, and makes it ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate unto our will confining the receiving or rejecting of it to times and ſeaſons of our own: When alas<note n="(a)" place="margin">John 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſpirit doth breath when and where it liſteth,</hi> and ſubjecting it to ſeveral alterations at our pleaſure, whereas it is perpetual and unchangeable in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It ſuſpendeth the fruit and application of Chriſt's death, the effectual working of the ſpirit, the ſaving pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God's Ordinances, with the beginning and progreſs of Grace; ſo by theſe means, our whole Salvation is in our hands. It gives man liberty to make all inward and outward means of grace either void or effectual at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which overthroweth the whole foundation of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, which attribute our whole Salvation to God alone,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:41737:100"/>and giveth the lye to God's word, which ſaith,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Epheſ. 2.1, 5.</note>

                  <hi>That God hath quickned us,</hi> and not we our ſelves; That <hi>without Chriſt we can do nothing,</hi> that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſpecial grace: And<note n="(c)" place="margin">Philip. 2.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>God worketh in us both to will and to do of his good pleaſure,</hi> and not according to our will and inclination. That it is<note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 4.7.</note>

                  <hi>by the grace of God only we are what we are;</hi> and ſo many more places to the ſame purpoſe, which wholly overthrow univerſal ſufficient grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This puts mankind in as good if no better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition after fall than before; <hi>Adam</hi> had only a poſſibility not to fall, but not to riſe after the fall; but we though naturally born in ſin, may after this rate riſe, if and when we pleaſe; he had a free will not to ſin, yet he did ſin, and was not born in ſin, but we who are ſinners from the Womb can ſave our ſelves if we have a mind to it, if ſo, no hurt is happened to us by his fall: On the contrary we are put in a better condition than before, for thereby Election, Vocation, Converſion, Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and every other ſaving grace are put in our power, that all theſe divine ſoul-ſaving graces do depend upon our corrupt wills, and contrary to Scripture are not <hi>the</hi>

                  <hi>gifts of God,</hi> and doth not this give men juſt occaſion to boaſt and glory in themſelves, whereby the chief end of grace is deſtroyed, which is to<note n="(g)" place="margin">Rom. 3.27.</note> 
                  <hi>take away boaſting from men,</hi> and have<note n="(h)" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.12, 14. Philip. 1.11.</note> 
                  <hi>all things to the praiſe of the glory of God.</hi> Another evil effect of theſe errors of theirs is, that they fruſtrate our Prayers and Thanks-givings and make trifles of them, for in vain we beg of another that which comes from us, and is in our own power; in vain we give thanks to another for that which we have, without him; ſo we need not thank God for any of his graces, ſeeing it is in our power to receive or reject them.</p>
               <p>In the next place this unavoidably draws many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies with it. <hi>Firſt</hi> of all, it brings in all manner of prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and licentiouſneſs, for what needs a man to care how wickedly he liveth for the preſent if it be in his power to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:41737:100"/>believe and repent when he will, is not this an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for prophane men to continue longer in ſin? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Theſe opinions are able to engage a man that hath no truth of grace in him, in any villany and deſperate attempt; he that wants true grace within to reſtrain him, will quickly run upon any evil act or courſe, upon this falſe preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he may preſently of himſelf repent and be ſaved after all his ſins. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This encourageth men to delay and put off repentance, and for the preſent to neglect the means of grace and all Chriſtian duties, for what is the chief ground of the common neglect both of means and works of grace? But this unhappy deluſion, that they may undoubtedly be converted, repent and be ſaved when they have amind to it; thus this doctrine of free-will, univerſal ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace openeth the door to all ſuch prophane and wicked licentiouſneſs and ſecurity, as the hearts of men can admit.</p>
               <p>Farthermore, this makes all men equal, puts them in the ſame condition whether Elect or Reprobate, Heathen or Chriſtians, Godly or Ungodly, ſince all of them may be ſaved or damned if they will, for thereby their Salvation is laid in their hand. Now what can be more derogatory to God's ſpecial grace and love, more uncomfortable to all good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, more acceptable to all licentious perſons, more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to Satan and pernicious to mankind, than to remove the bounds of God's all limiting and immutable decrees, and throw down the walls, hedges and partitions he hath made himſelf of his ſpecial love, and to lay them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto all without diſtinction, and as much as in them lays, to ruin the order which God hath ſettled and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bring in a general confuſion?</p>
               <p>Again, this takes away repentance and ſalvation it ſelf, alſo the hopes and poſſibility of repentance, for if our converſion, grace and Salvation, depend upon our unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled corrupt wills, who can be ſaved? If <hi>Adam</hi> in a ſtate of Innocency could not preſerve himſelf from falling, when he had power not to ſin, how can we who ſince his fall, lay under a neceſſity of ſinning, even in a regenerate ſtate, by any ſufficient univerſal grace or any power of our own, raiſe, convert, or ſave our ſelves?

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:41737:101"/>grace of God did abound, thought he could not do't:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 7.14, 15, 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good, I find not: for the good that I would I do not; but the evil which I would not that I do.</hi> If our Salvation was in our own hands it ſhould ſoon be loſt and forfeited, but thanks be to God 'tis in ſure hands:<note n="(b)" place="margin">John 10.28, 29.</note>

                  <hi>the ſure mercies of David.</hi> This alſo doth exclude Infants from Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for they want knowledge to diſcern, and will for to deſire it, becauſe they know not what it meaneth.</p>
               <p>Moreover, this revives the old <hi>Pelagian</hi> Error, that a man may live and keep himſelf without ſin, for if men have ſuch an ability of will, of univerſal grace to convert themſelves when they are in the ſtate of nature, much more ſhall they in the ſtate of grace, when they enjoy the help of God's ſpirit, keep themſelves free from ſin; if once through their ſtrength men have maſtered ſin, much more may they totally ſuppreſs it being wounded; but Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth there is no perfection to be attained to in this life, no perfect man in the world,<note n="(d)" place="margin">Jam. 3.2. &amp; chap. 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>for in many things we offend all,</hi> and though we ſhould offend only in one, <hi>he who offendeth in one is guilty of all.</hi> The beloved diſciple of Chriſt and in whom his grace aboundeth, ſaith,<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 John 1.8.</note> 
                  <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> Their opinions do croſs one another, for to put in man's will to keep himſelf from ſin if he willeth, doth not agree with their doctrine againſt perſeverance, for 'tis to be ſuppoſed no man is willingly damned; the deſire of well being is in the Creature, and to be againſt perſeverance doth continually bring a ſervile fear upon men, and always keeps them under uncertainty as to their future ſtate, contrary to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note n="(f)" place="margin">Rom. 8.15</note>

               </p>
               <p>This alſo maketh grace of a larger extent than the decree of God's Election and the inward or outward means of grace; That is, the effect is more general than its cauſe, which is a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:41737:101"/>very great abſurdity, God hath not actually decreed to ſave, nor by a call to offer ſoul-ſaving means of grace to all men; for if it were ſo as they would have it, I ſee no reaſon but that all men ſhould be converted and ſaved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God's decrees and his words are always true, and never fall to ground for want of execution; but Scripture and Experience teach the contrary. Wherefore either we muſt admit an univerſal Election of all men to life, which neceſſarily implyeth an univerſal Salvation of all Men, or elſe we muſt, diſclaim a <hi>Chimaera</hi> of univerſal grace which may well be called a Monſter in Divinity. Another ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this univerſal grace is, that it makes this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended grace (which is not ſufficient to Salvation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it doth not produce it) Mother to true ſaving grace which is of a quite different nature; but ſuch is the cauſe, ſuch the effect.<note n="(a)" place="margin">Matth. 7.16.</note> 
                  <hi>Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thiſtles?</hi> Either this univerſal grace is ſaving grace which cannot be, for all men would be ſaved by it, or elſe it cannot be the Mother or Author of true ſaving grace, which ſo far differeth from it in kind or nature: We own there are God's common temporal favours, whereof Reprobates are made partakers, becauſe living in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Society of the Elect, they thereby receive ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward benefits which in that reſpect may be called univerſal graces; but the queſtion is about effectual and ſaving grace, ſuch as inward calling, Converſion, Juſtification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are peculiar to God's Elect and not extended to Heathen and other Infidels, who are no part nor members of the viſible Church, much leſs of the univerſal Church which, promiſes and ſaving graces do only belong to; ſo that without the Pales of it, no true ſaving grace to be had: to the end that univerſal grace be ſufficient it muſt contain other particular graces as Faith; if it be Faith it ceaſes to be univerſal, for it doth not belong to all, or elſe what our Saviour ſaith,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Luke 18.8.</note> 
                  <hi>when the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he find faith in the Earth?</hi> Were but a tale, if it be not faith it ſignifieth nothing, and will do no good; 'tis not ſufficient, for<note n="(c)" place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note>

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:41737:102"/>
               <p>If this be a true univerſal grace, it muſt be a grace for every thing, or elſe 'tis not univerſal, it muſt unfold to us all the myſteries of God's proceeding's, ſpecially thoſe which relate to Salvation: as for us who do not believe it, when we inquire into things, the laſt reaſon that can be given us, is the will of God; no higher can be aſſigned, therewith we are ſatisfied and do acquieſce, we go no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for thereby a ſtop is put to all our queries: But for them, that univerſal grace giveth an apparent cauſe even in men themſelves, beſides the abſolute diſpoſing will of God; namely the previſion of their Faith, their perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, their good uſe of grace received, their original and actual ſins and final impenitency; why one man is prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to ſalvation not another? So it unveils to them thoſe high and unſearchable myſteries of Gods decrees which put St. <hi>Paul</hi> to a <hi>nonplus,</hi> or elſe he had not been ſtrucken with ſuch amazing admiration as made him cry out,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> 
                  <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding-out.</hi> Surely he wanted that univerſal grace, or elſe he would not have thought thoſe judgments ſo incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though I would have the Adverſaries of the truth to know, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wanted no grace, he had a ſufficient grace,<note n="(b)" place="margin">2 Cor. 12 9.</note> 
                  <hi>My grace is ſufficient unto thee:</hi> But that ſufficient grace in <hi>Paul</hi> was for another end, it never went ſo far as <hi>Arminians</hi> pretends theirs doth; yet they muſt give us leave to think, he was inferiour in grace to none of them, nor <hi>David</hi> who ſaith,<note n="(c)" place="margin">Pſal. 36.6.</note>

                  </gap>e is a free-will to good in us. And as to Providence, that God hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined contingencies, nor foreſeen future contingents and ſuch others as <hi>Arminians</hi> have borrowed from <hi>Socinians,</hi> as in the miſtakes concerning the high point of juſtification, Chriſt's ſatisfaction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then they deny the knowledge and confeſſion of the myſtery of the Trinity to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, and that the Doctrine of the three perſons of the Godhead, ſpecially of Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God from Eternity, are not a fundamental Article of our Faith, as affirmed in their <hi>Apolog.

In few words that moſt of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctors do in the Article of the Trinity, which they make to be of no great moment go hand in hand with <hi>Socinians,</hi> hath clearly been made out by <hi>Vedclius, Part</hi> 2. <hi>Arcanorum Armin.</hi> and what I have here charged them with and other things too, I am able to make good out of their publick writings, as the <hi>Apology, Vindic.</hi> and out of the works of their moſt approved eminent Authors, as <hi>Worſtius,</hi> whom they would
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:41737:103"/>have had promoted to be Divinity Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden</hi> after <hi>Arminius</hi>'s death, <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> the chief manager of their Affairs in the Synod of <hi>Dort, Curcelaeus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But all theſe and more too, ill conſequences in matters of Doctrine, I now muſt conclude with the bad influence it hath upon life and converſation. It is too true as we find it by experience, that there are multitudes of wretches kept in their carnal ſecurity, by a perſwaſion that there is an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal grace offered unto all, by which they may repent and believe when they will; this makes them reſolve to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin a little longer, and then they will receive and entertain grace, and ſo, eaſily get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, which is a great encouragement to all wickedneſs; but it ſuits with the nature and deſire of wicked, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and prophane ſinners, who though they were not fully perſwaded of it, yet for them tis a pretence to continue in ſin. 'Tis ſaid of one <hi>Thompſon,</hi> a great propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gator of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> that when he was in his fits of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, if any one minded him of the wrath of God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt ſuch courſes, he would anſwer, <hi>I am a child of the devil to day, but I have free-will, and to morrow I will make my ſelf a child of God. Janſenius</hi> hath made this general obſervation, that the <hi>Pelagians</hi> were generally looſe in their lives which he taketh abundance of good Pains to prove; and I conceive it cannot be too much conſidered in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, becauſe <hi>Pelagius</hi> urged nothing more vehemently than this, that the extolling of the grace of God and leſſening the liberty of man's will, is the readieſt way to deſtroy all Piety. By thoſe that for a conſiderable time have conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt Papiſts, 'tis obſerved how the <hi>Janſeniſts</hi> are the beſt moral livers amongſt them, of a much better life and converſation than the reſt; ſo it cannot but be taken notice of that amongſt us the greateſt ſticklers for <hi>Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm,</hi> even amongſt ſome of the Clergy, are the proudeſt moſt vicious, Ambitious, Voluptuous, Drunkards, prophane, livers of any, making little or no conſcience to ſeek the glory of God, to feed their flocks, amongſt which they ſeldom are reſident, except in ſheering time, for to feed they care not ſo much as to fleece the Flock, making not much conſcience of performing Paſtoral Duties, being more for
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41737:103"/>wealth and preferment, than for the good of ſouls: If their Doctrine be good, why are their lives and actions ſo vicious? I ſpeak for the generality, their practice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth what they would have us to believe of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; their bad lives they would ſhelter under the notion of a good Doctrine, the goodneſs of their Religion muſt be a cloak; but we with a good life would, as much as the frailty and corruption of our nature can permit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to credit the doctrine we profeſs, and becauſe we will not run into the ſame exceſſes as others do, we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently are by them branded with the name of preciſe and moroſe <hi>Puritans.</hi> If they do well, they attribute it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to the right uſe they make of their free-will, to their own will and inclination: But if in us there be any thing better than in others, we wholly (as 'tis moſt due) attribute it to free-grace, the glory of all we return to God and not to any will of ours, for no good is done in or by us, but what comes from God's free-grace, to which, ſpecially in matter of Salvation, we can never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute too much, nor too little to our own ſtrength: So that whilſt their principles lead them to looſeneſs and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ours, or rather Gods in us, lead us to holineſs and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous practices, and if thorough the corruption of our nature they do not as it ſhould, we confeſs it ought ſo to be. Let them ſhew us their faith by their works, for by the fruit we judge of the Tree. Now bad actions and a viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out life do naturally and neceſſarily flow from their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and whilſt, as I ſaid before,<note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Pet. 2.19.</note> they promiſe others liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption.</p>
               <p>Now if there be ſuch an univerſal ſufficient grace im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to all men, whereby they may be ſaved if they will; why then from the Creation till now have not the effectual means of ſaving grace been imparted alike? which if ſo, then all or moſt had been ſaved; which not being it muſt proceed from a want either of will or of power; I cannot believe it is for want of a will, for though people, out of their own corruption, be willing enough to procraſtinate repentance, and like <hi>Sampſon,</hi> be lulled a ſleep in their <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah</hi>'s boſom, yet when they hear or ſee the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi>
                  <note n="(b)" place="margin">Judg. 16.19.</note> the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:41737:104"/>approaches of death, dangerous ſickneſſes, heavy afflictions and terrors of Conſcience are coming upon them, ſurely none are ſo prodigal of their own Souls, or ſo deſirous of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but would unfeignedly deſire to be ſaved,<note n="(a)" place="margin">Numb. 23.1</note> 
                  <hi>let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his,</hi> was the deſire of that wicked falſe Prophet, <hi>Balaam.</hi> And as <hi>Sampſon</hi> would have drawn up together all his forces, to have overcome his Enemies, he found his ſtrength was gone; <hi>The Lord was departed from him.</hi> So thoſe ſinners who were lulled a ſleep with thoſe pretty fancies of a power to repent, believe and be ſaved, when it comes to the puſh, they find there is no ſuch thing in them as they were made to believe. In <hi>Sampſon,</hi> his ſtrength was gone, for once he had it; but that free-will and power which <hi>Arminians</hi> do brag of, no man ever had: Therefore at laſt they muſt be convinced how in man is no ſuch a power whereby to be ſaved when he will.</p>
               <p>Now to ſum up all in few words: Horrible abſurdities follow on the <hi>Arminian</hi> opinions, ſome whereof they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and others are bound on their back by unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſequences: Namely that the fruit of Chriſt's death doth abſolutely depend upon the accidental aſſent of man's free-will, that notwithſtanding his death, it was poſſible and very contingent that all men had periſhed, That no ſoul had been free from Hell by his Blood; That God ſhould never have had any Church at all; That now by vertue of his death, true grace is given to all; That all Pagans as well under the Law as the Goſpel, who never heard of Scripture, are truly reconciled to God by the death of his Son; That all Infants, even of Heathens, who die before the years of diſcretion are ſaved by Chriſt; That in no man is any original ſin, but every one when he is born is put in the ſtate of Innocency; That Baptiſm is not neceſſary, for no ſin is therein remitted, becauſe there is none then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> How Arminianiſm is contrary to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WIth a ſort of men, namely, thoſe that are zealous, for the Religion of their Fathers, and true Sons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I make no doubt but that this will be a weighty and prevailing Argument, which for their ſake and information before I have done, I hope by the grace of God to make good, and thereby to ſhew the diſingenuity and deſign of thoſe who to impoſe upon ſeveral people, have the face to affirm Arminianiſm to be the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> which is ſo contrary to truth.</p>
               <p>To underſtand this well, it muſt be explained what is meant by the Doctrine of the Church; 'tis not the opinions of ſome corrupt Members of the Church, whom that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſowns as ſpurious, becauſe fallen from her Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and having ſet up Errors of their own, which ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taught them, though they would father them upon her; ſhe hath fed them with pure and ſincere milk, which their own ill conſtitution hath turned into Poyſon. But what we call the true Doctrine of the Church is that which was received, believed and taught in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reformation from errors and abuſes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and without alteration by her ſelf, laſted for above threeſcore years after, till a party here combined to bring in erroneous innovations of their own: In few words we call that the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which concerning theſe controverted points is contained in the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> in the Common Prayer Book, the Book
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41737:105"/>of Homilies, and the Catechiſm of <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. Theſe are the general, publick, and authentical Records and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences of the Faith and Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and we ſhall not want the Teſtimony of the moſt Eminent and famous Doctors thereof to prove what we ſay. So then we ſhall make it appear, how <hi>Arminiamſm</hi> is contrary to all this, I mean, in every one of theſe we ſhall find Teſtimonies againſt it.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, to begin with the Articles of Faith. We have the 17th. about Predeſtination in theſe Words. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination to life is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Foundation of the World was laid he hath conſtantly decreed by his Counſel ſecret to us, to deliver from Curſe and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt, and to bring them unto everlaſting Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Let the whole be read with At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and what we have aſſerted about that Point will be found therein to be contained; as the eternity of God's Decree, <hi>everlaſting</hi> Purpoſe, its immutability hath <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly</hi> decreed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But becauſe, if I ſhould point at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word confirming what I am about proving out of this Article, it would take up too much time. To do it more effectually, I ſhall make uſe of another Man's Pen, I mean of Mr. <hi>Thomas Rogers,</hi> a Man beyond exception in the Caſe, who was a Chaplain to Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft.</hi> He hath written an Analyſis upon all the 39 Articles which he doth dedicate to the Archbiſhop, and the Book is licens'd and printed by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. The Doctrines contained in every Article, he reduces under ſeveral Heads and Propoſitions, which he proves out of Scripture; and theſe Propoſitions he, in his Epiſtle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory, affirmeth to be maintained by the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which, if it had not been true, he would not have had the Face to have ſaid ſo in Print to the Primate of the whole Kingdom. To add a greater weight to what he writes, I muſt warn the Reader he was no <hi>Puritan,</hi> nor Friend to them, as it appeareth out of his Book, and ſo no <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt,</hi> to make uſe of their Words. He out of this 17th. Article draweth ten Propoſitions; the <hi>1ſt. That there is a Predeſtination of Men unto everlaſting Life.</hi> 2. <hi>Predeſtination hath been from everlaſting:</hi> Here is the eternity. 3. <hi>They
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41737:105"/>which are predeſtinated unto Salvation cannot periſh:</hi> This is Perſeverance, and againſt the Apoſtacy of Saints. 4. <hi>Not all Men, but certain, are predeſtinated to be ſaved:</hi> Here is a certain number of Choſen and Elect 5. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus, of the meer Will and purpoſe of God, ſome are elected, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, unto Salvation:</hi> Here are Election and Rebrobation, and no outward Motive in God but his meer Will and Purpoſe. In the 6th. and 7th. Propoſitions, he makes the outward Calling by the Word, and inward by the Holy Ghoſt, the Juſtification by Faith of thoſe that are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, their Sanctification by the Holy Ghoſt, and Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in the Life to come, to be infallible Effects of free Election. Take notice alſo, how in his Proofs of the firſt Propoſition, he makes uſe of the Examples of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> as Examples of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation. And amongſt thoſe whom he condemns as Adverſaries to this Truth (for of the Truth he aſſerts in every Propoſition, he names thoſe that are againſt it,) he expreſſes thoſe that ſay, how ſome are appointed to be ſaved but none to be damned. And upon the 4th. Propoſition he condemneth thoſe who ſay, no certain Company be fore-deſtined unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condemnation. Upon his 5th. Propoſition he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth of Impiety (that's his Word) thoſe who ſay, that Man maketh himſelf eligible for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; thoſe who ſay, that God beheld in every Man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would uſe his Grace well, and believe the Goſpel or no, and as he ſaw a Man affected, ſo he did predeſtinate, chooſe, or refuſe him. And thoſe that ſay, that beſides God's Will, there was in him ſome other Cauſe why he choſe one, and caſt off another. O <hi>Arminians!</hi> here by a true Son of the Church, according to the Doctrine of the Church, you are charged with Impiety for your Opinions. More of this is to be ſeen in the Book, which for Brevities ſake I omit. One Evidence more of a true Son of the Church, I ſhall make uſe of upon this point, which alſo proves our 13th. Chapter in the very Words:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Reply to <hi>Fiſher, p.</hi> 275.</note> 
                  <hi>Although our Tenet concerning predeſtination, be no other than St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>and his Scholars maintained againſt the</hi> Pelagians, ſaith Dr. <hi>Francis White,</hi> Dean of <hi>Carliſle.</hi> As to Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi>'s Book,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41737:106"/>ſomething elſe I ſhall add, how therein in matter of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination he ſaith, as do all the Churches Militant and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a ſweet conſent teſtifie and acknowledge. Then all ſuch Churches agree againſt <hi>Arminians</hi> in theſe points.</p>
               <p>For free-Will we muſt read the 10th. Article. <hi>The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Man after the fall of</hi> Adam <hi>is ſuch, that he cannot turn and prepare himſelf by his own natural Strength and good Works to Faith and calling upon God; wherefore we have no power to do good Works pleaſing and acceptable unto God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Grace of God preventing us, that we may have a good will and working with us, when we have that good will.</hi> This is plain enough as obſerved by <hi>Rogers,</hi> how Man cannot do any good Work before he be regenerated and converted: And he declares Adverſaries to this Truth, <hi>all ſuch as hold, that naturally there is free-will in us;</hi> and that <hi>Man hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to perform ſpiritual and heavenly things.</hi> Again, that Men believe not, but of their own free-Will: That it is in a Man's free-Will to believe, or not to believe, to obey or diſobey the Goſpel of Truth preached. This is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we aſſert, in as plain and proper Words as can be expreſſed. And on his 3d. Propoſition upon the ſame Article, he brings in the very ſame Texts we make uſe of for that purpoſe: As,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Acts 15.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As to the certainty of Salvation and for Perſeverance, 'tis contained in the already-quoted 17th. Article, where 'tis ſaid, <hi>God hath conſtantly decreed by his Counſel ſecret to us, to bring thoſe he hath choſen in Chriſt and by Chriſt to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Salvotion.</hi> Whence it doth follow, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly ſuch ſhall be brought to Salvation, or elſe God could not execute that which he hath decreed to do, which is Blaſphemy. Now the Adverſaries are for Mutability and in conſtancy of Salvation, which certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Article doth croſs; for it induceth a certain and conſtant Salvation, and a conſtant Decree of Election, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:41737:106"/>bringing to Salvation; which muſt be by way of Perſeverance in the State of Grace: But they by inducing this Apoſtacy, and that Men, though elected, may have leave to fall from Salvation if they will, make an Election which followeth a Man upon condition of his fore-ſeen Perſeverance, a ſtrange Election that waits upon Man; to ſee whether he will give to himſelf a final Perſeverance by his own free-Will; an Election by which no Man is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally elected until he be no more, that is, after his death. In this Article the Church hath another way to teach the certainty of Salvation, which is, to go upon the ſame Grounds St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth, when he ſaith by Particulars to make the General ſure.<note n="(f)" place="margin">Rom. 8.29.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Whom he did fore-know, them he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did predeſtinate to be made like to the Image of his Son. Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called; whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Foundation in the ſaid Article are theſe Words: <hi>Wherefore they which be endued with ſo excellent a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of God, be called according to God's purpoſe, by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, they through Grace obey the Calling: They be juſtified freely; they be made Sons of God by Adoption; they be made like unto the Image of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt; they walk religiouſly in good works, and at length, by God's Mercy, they attain to everlaſting Felicity.</hi> Here are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Particulars by which that general bringing to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is perfected: ſo that to joyn both together, it is but one and the ſame; and from firſt to laſt there is ſuch an indiſſoluble Connexion, that he who is elected to eternal Life ſhall infallibly have it. Upon this certitude and aſſurance it is, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes nothing can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of eternal Life, becauſe nothing can ſeparate us from the love of God, which is the Ground of our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Wherefore he defieth any thing or perſon to do it, though <hi>Arminians</hi> undertake to accept of the Apoſtle's Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, not caring how they come within his Defiance: For they ſeem to anſwer, that there are many, or ſome things, that can ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt; tho' after and before a long Enumeration, St. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes, <hi>In all things theſe we are more than conquerours:</hi> And <hi>Job will truſt
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41737:107"/>in God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 13.15.</note> 
                  <hi>though he kill him.</hi> Now that which maketh us to Conquer is not our own free-Will, but it is <hi>God that loved us.</hi> In conformity to this, in the ſame Article it is ſaid, <hi>The conſideration of Election doth greatly eſtabliſh in the Saints, and confirm their Faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through Chriſt.</hi> And the ſame Interpreter upon the 17th. Article, in his 3d. Propoſition, out of the Words <hi>conſtantly decreed,</hi> doth infer this; <hi>Wander then do they from the truth, which think that the very Elect, totally and finally, may fall from Grace and be damned,</hi> &amp;c. I think this is very clear for us. And in the latter end of his 8th. Propoſition, he condemneth thoſe who call the Doctrine of Predeſtination a licentious Doctrine.</p>
               <p>As to the point of Juſtification, which is a Fundamental Article of our Religion, and much corrupted by <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> the xi. Article of the 39. ſaith, <hi>We are accounted Righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt, by Faith, and not for our own Works and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings.</hi> Theſe laſt Words do reach <hi>Arminians</hi> as well as <hi>Papiſts;</hi> for free Will, Faith, Perſeverance, right uſe and improvement of Means, do come under the Word <hi>Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings.</hi> There is then nothing of Man; and <hi>Rogers,</hi> in the Proofs of his 1ſt. Propoſition, explains it thus, <hi>By his only Righteouſneſs we are juſtified.</hi> It expreſſes only Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and excludeth any thing elſe. But I muſt not be too long upon this. Out of what hath been ſaid, I hope it doth appear, how of the 39 Articles, thoſe which ſpeak about theſe Matters, are clearly for us againſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we muſt come to the Liturgy or Common-Prayer-Book, which now and then, and in ſeveral places, doth ſtrike againſt thoſe Errors, and for the Truth. And as the Church teaches us thoſe Doctrines by Articles of Faith, ſo in the Liturgy ſhe doth confirm it by Practice. But before I come to it, I muſt take notice of ſome Paſſages in the Catechiſm, which is alſo a publick Record and Evidence of the Doctrine of the Church: <hi>Know this, that thou art not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do theſe things of thy ſelf, nor to walk in the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and to ſerve him without his ſpecial Grace.</hi> See
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:41737:107"/>alſo the Anſwer to the firſt Queſtion about the Lord's Prayer, <hi>I deſire,</hi> &amp;c. Read the Anſwer to the 4th. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, <hi>and by God's help ſo I will,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now to come to Particulars out of the Prayer-Book. In one place we have thus:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Collect on <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</note> 
                  <hi>Grant that we being regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and made thy Children by Adoption and Grace, may daily be renewed by thy holy Spirit.</hi> Thoſe Benefits we receive as effects of Grace, not of our free-Will; and our being renewed is by God's Holy Spirit, not by our Will: If it be by one, it is not by the other; becauſe in Matters of Salvation, Grace and natural Strength are oppoſed.

                  <hi>As by thy ſpecial Grace preventing us, thou doſt put into our Minds good Deſires, ſo by thy continual help, we may bring the ſame to good effect.</hi> This is plain and full againſt <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians:</hi> If there be good Thoughts in our Mind, good Deſires in our Heart, it is God alone that puts it therein: By what Motive, and upon what Account? Not for any thing in us, but by his Grace; nay, his ſpecial, not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon univerſal Grace, not for our Faith, Repentance, good Works, right uſe of Means, but by his <hi>ſpecial</hi> Grace, <hi>preventing</hi> Grace, before we can think and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But this is not all; for as the beginning is from God, as are Deſires, ſo is the Progreſs; for we pray for his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual help, ſo alſo is the end, that we may bring the ſame good Thoughts and Deſires to good effect: Without that help nothing doth, or can come to any good. We have more than this to ſhew:<note n="(e)" place="margin">

They are obſtinate Slaves to their Paſſions, therefore called unruly: None but God can order them; nothing under a Divine Power

                  <hi>Rule the Heart of thy Servant the King: The Hearts of Kings are in thy Rule and Governance, and thou doſt diſpoſe and turn them as it ſeemeth beſt to thy godly Wiſdom: We humbly beſeech thee to diſpoſe and govern the Heart of thy Servant, our King, that in all his Thoughts, Words and Works, he may ever ſeek thy Honour and Glory.</hi> If Men have free-Will and Power to do thoſe things, as to purifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, why do we pray for them? 'Tis in vain for us to pray to God to do for us that which we can do our ſelves. But if therein we want his Aſſiſtance, then we muſt need want that Power. I ſhall conclude with two or three places out of the <hi>Litany;</hi> where 'tis prayed for the King, <hi>That his Heart may be ruled in the Faith, Fear, and Love of God.</hi> In another place, That <hi>the Church may be called, and univerſally governed in the right way;</hi> and, <hi>That God would bring into the way of truth all ſuch as have erred and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> Here the Church doth plainly acknowledge the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of God's Grace on the Wills and Hearts of Men; for when we pray that God's Grace may work ſuch Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, 'tis owned ſuch Effects to be the proper Works of God's Grace. One thing more I ſhall take notice of, and it is this: In a Prayer are theſe Words; <hi>We beſeech thee for all ſorts and conditions of Men, that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed to make thy ways known unto them.</hi> Hence we ſee, how Men cannot of themſelves know God's Ways, but it is God that makes them known unto them; therefore we therein be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech God to do it: Which if it were not proper for God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, the Prayer would be in vain. Hence we alſo learn the Senſe of the Church, as to the ſignification of the word <hi>all</hi> uſed in Scripture, as it ought to be the Object of our Prayers, and then by a conſequence apply it to thoſe for whom Chriſt died, againſt an univerſal Redemption in their way; for in the Collect it is not ſaid, for every ſingle and individual Man, but for all ſorts and conditions of Men.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed. We ſhould bring ſomething out of the Book of Homilies, and of the authoriſed Catechiſm of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the 6th. As to the firſt take notice of the following
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:41737:109"/>places out of the Edition quoted in the Margin.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>London,</hi> 1623. Part. 1. pag. 8. Epheſ. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>in many places painteth us out in our own Colours, calling us the Children of the Wrath of God when we were born: Saying alſo that we cannot think a good Thought of our ſelves; much leſs can we we ſay or do well of our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And we be of our ſelves of ſuch Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>as can bring forth nothing but Weeds, Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Brambles, Bryars, Cockle and Darnel; we have neither Faith, Charity, Hope, Patience, Chaſtity, nor any thing elſe that good is, but of God; and therefore theſe Vertues are called there, the Fruits of the Holy Ghoſt, and not the Fruits of Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another place: <hi>Of our ſelves and by our ſelves, we have no Goodneſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">part 1. p. 11. and Part 2. p. 181, 182, 183.</note> 
                  <hi>Help nor Salvation, but contrariwiſe Sin, Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Death everlaſting— Our Salvation comes only by Chriſt: We are all become unclean, but are not able to cleanſe our ſelves, nor to make one another of us clean. We are by nature Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God's Wrath, but we are not able to make our ſelves the Children and Inheritors of God's Glory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He is the God, who of his own Mercy ſaveth us, and ſetteth out his Charity and exceeding Love towards us, in that of his own voluntary Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when we periſhed, he ſaved us, and provided an everlaſting Kingdom for us: And all theſe Heavenly Treaſures are given us, not for our Deſert, Merit, or good Deeds, which of our ſelves we have none, but of his meer Mercy freely.</hi> Doth not this whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and only attribute our Salvation to the free Grace of God in Chriſt, and conſequently excludeth any thing in or from us, to move God to be ſo gracious to us?</p>
               <p>As to the great point of our Juſtification before God, in the Sermon <hi>of the Salvation of Mankind</hi> by only Chriſt our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour from Sin and Death everlaſting, are theſe Words: <hi>But our Juſtification doth come freely by the Mercy of God of ſo great and free Mercy, that whereas all the World was not able of themſelves, to pay any part towards their Ranſom, it pleaſed our heavenly Father of his infinite Mercy, without any our Deſerts, to prepare for us the moſt precious Jewels of Chriſt's Body and Blood,</hi> &amp;c. And further, to ſhew there is nothing of ours,<note place="margin">Part 2. p. 172.</note> it is ſaid elſewhere, <hi>It is of the free Grace and Mercy of God, by the Mediation of the Blood of his Son Jeſus

                  <note place="margin">Part 2. p. 81, 82.</note> 
                  <hi>that our Sins are forgiven us; that we are reconciled and brought again into his Favour, and made Heirs of his Heavenly Kingdom.</hi> And as to the Certainty and Immutability of our Election, it is ſaid in another place, <hi>Let us by ſuch Virtues as ought to ſpring out of Faith, ſhew our Election to be ſure and ſtable,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part 1. p. 28.29.</note> &amp;c. And elſewhere we read this: <hi>The holy Man,</hi> Simon, <hi>ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part 2. p. 152.</note> 
                  <hi>that Chriſt is ſet forth for the fall and riſing again of many in</hi> Iſrael. <hi>As Chriſt Jeſus is a fall to Reprobates, which yet periſh through their own Defaults; ſo is his Word, yea the whole Book of God, a cauſe of Damnation unto them through their Incredulity,</hi> &amp;c. Furthermore, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, the Prophets, the Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>and all the true Miniſters of his Word, yea every jot and tittle in the Holy Scripture have been, is, and ſhall be for evermore the Sauour of Life unto eternal Life, unto all thoſe whoſe Hearts God hath purified by true Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>God of his mercy and ſpecial Favour towards them whom he hath appointed to everlaſting Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, hath ſo offered his Grace eſpecially, and they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it ſo fruitfully, that altho' by reaſon of their ſinful living out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, they ſeemed before to have been the Children of Wrath and Perdition; yet now the Spirit of God mightily working in them, unto the obedience to God's Will and Commandments; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare by their outward Deeds and Life, in the ſhewing of Mercy and Charity, which cannot come but of the Spirit of God, and his ſpecial Grace, that they are the undoubted Children of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to everlaſting Life,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For a further confirmation of this, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Godly, as they muſt certainly know and perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Part 2. p. 172.</note> 
                  <hi>that all Goodneſs, all Bounty, all Mercy, all Benefits, all Forgiveneſs of Sins, and whatſoever can be named good and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, either for the Body or for the Soul, do come only of God's Mercy and meer Favour, and not of themſelves. So,</hi> &amp;c. p. 199. we have thus: <hi>It is the Holy Ghoſt, and no other thing, that doth quicken the Minds of Men, ſtirring up good and godly Motions in their Hearts, which are agreeable to the Will and Commandment of God; ſuch as otherwiſe of their own crooked and perverſe nature, they ſhould never have—Man of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is carnal, corrupt, and naught, ſinful and diſobedient to God, without any ſpark of Goodneſs in him, without any vertuous
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:41737:110"/>or godly motion, only given to evil thoughts and wicked deeds; as for the works of the ſpirit, the fruits of faith, charitable and good motions, if he have any at all in him, they proceed only of the holy ghoſt, who is the only worker of our ſanctification, and maketh us new men in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And page 219. <hi>his power and wiſdom compell us to take him for God Omnipotent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all thing in his ſubjection, and will have none in Council with him, nor any to ask the reaſon of his doing, for he may do what liketh him, and none can reſiſt him, for he worketh all things in his ſecret judgment, to his own pleaſure, yea even the wicked to damnation, ſaith</hi> Solomon.... David <hi>would make anſwer for all, know ye, for ſurely even the Lord is God, he hath made us and not we our ſelves.... Not to us, O Lord! not to us, but to thy name give all the thanks, for thy loving mercy.... Verily the holy prophet</hi> Eſay <hi>beareth record, and ſaith, O Lord, it is then of thy goodneſs that hath wrought all our works in us, not we our ſelves.... St.</hi> Paul <hi>bringeth in his belief, We be not, ſaith he, ſufficient of our ſelves as of our ſelves once to think any thing; but all our ableneſs is of God's goodneſs, for he it is in whom we have all our being, our living and moving.</hi> And pag. 228. <hi>It is he that preventeth our will and diſpoſeth us thereunto:</hi> That is, as ſaid before, Faith, Charity, and Repentance. And <hi>p.</hi> 229. <hi>For without his ſecret and lively inſpiration, can we not once ſo much as ſpeak the name of our mediator... It is he that purgeth and purifieth the mind by his ſecret working.... He lightneth the heart,</hi> &amp;c. And p. 263. <hi>We muſt beware and take heed, that we do in no wiſe think in our hearts, imagine or believe that we are able to repent aright, or to turn effectually unto the Lord by our own ſtrength... For this cauſe although</hi> Jeremiah <hi>had ſaid before, If thou return, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>return unto me; yet afterwards he ſaith, Turn thou me, O Lord and I ſhall be turned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Why ſhould I longer inſiſt upon this which is ſo full and ſo clear; let thoſe that have a mind to know more of it read the Firſt and Second Parts of the Homilies of the miſery of Man, with the Homilies of Chriſt's Nativity, Paſſion, and Reſurrection. The firſt on <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> the Firſt, Second and Third part of that on <hi>Rogation</hi>-week; and the Firſt part of that of Repentance. And as to the points of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41737:110"/>our Election, Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, beſides the foreſaid, let them read the Firſt, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and Third parts of the Homilies of Salvation and Faith. And out of all they ſhall find that there is an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immutable predeſtination of certain Men unto eternal Life out of meer grace and free-mercy; and a paſſing by or reprobation of others to eternal Death out of Gods meer pleaſure. That there is no free-will or ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent grace communicated unto all men, whereby they may convert and ſave themſelves if they will; on the contrary that Man without the ſpecial help of Gods ſpirit, and grace is ſo weak that he can neither think any thing that is good, nor prepare his heart to ſeek for grace. That Chriſt dyed intentionally and effectually for none but the Elect, that Gods grace and ſpirit do always work effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the hearts of the Elect in the act of their Converſion, which they can never totally nor finally reſiſt; and that the ſame Elect do never, nor can wholly and finally fall from the ſtate of grace. In theſe Homilies which for the moſt part were compiled by the learned Martyr <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> doth appear the ſpirit of our firſt Reformers to have been wholly for free-grace againſt free-will, or any thing of merit or ſtrength in man.</p>
               <p>Another Authentick proof, of the Doctrine of the Church againſt <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> is taken out of a ſhort Catechiſm pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in the time of good King <hi>Edward 6th.</hi> It was Compoſed by <hi>John Ponet</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and before its publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was preſented to the King, who committed the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal thereof to ſome Biſhops and other learned men, who aſſured his Majeſty it agreed with Scripture and the Statutes of the Kingdom, whereupon by his ſpecial command it was not only Printed in Latine and Engliſh, in the Year 1553, The next after the firſt publiſhing of the 39 Articles: So that we may well look upon it as a perfect Comment on them, but he alſo prefixed his own Epiſtle, wherein he did command all School-maſters within the Kingdom, carefully and diligently to teach it in all their Schools: There in one of the Scholars anſwers to the Maſter, 'tis ſaid, <hi>But as many as are in the faith ſtedfaſt were fore-choſen,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:41737:111"/>predeſtinate and appointed to everlaſting life before the world was made.</hi> And in another thus; <hi>The firſt, principal and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe of our Juſtification and Salvation, is the goodneſs and love of God whereby he choſe us for his before he made the world, after that he granted us to be called by the preaching of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, when the ſpirit of the Lord is poured into us by whoſe guidance and governance we be led to ſettle our truſt in God... From the ſame ſpirit alſo cometh our ſanctification, the love of God and our Neighbour, juſtice and uprightneſs of life, finally, whatſoever is in us or may be done of us honeſt, pure, true and good, that altogether ſpringeth out of this moſt pleaſant Rock, from this moſt plentiful fountain the goodneſs, love, choice and unchangeable purpoſe of God, he is the cauſe, the reſt are the fruits and effects.... It is meant thereby that faith or rather truſt alone, doth lay hand upon, underſtand and perceive our righteous making to be given us of God freely: That is to ſay, by no deſert of our own, but by the free grace of the Almighty Father.... For not by the worthineſs of our deſervings were we either heretofore choſen or long ago ſaved; but by the only mercy of God and pure grace of Chriſt our Lord, whereby we were in him made to do theſe good works, that God hath appointed for us to walk in...</hi> And fol. 68. <hi>Immortality and bleſſed life, God hath provided for his choſen, before the foundation of the world was laid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To what hath been ſaid, out of fol. 7, 8, 12. I ſhall add few words more. <hi>The image of God in man by original ſin and evil cuſtom was ſo obſcured, that man himſelf could not ſufficiently underſtand the difference between good and bad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween juſt and unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>from theſe and other actions of Chriſt two benefits do accrue unto us, one that whatſoever he did, he did it all for our profit; ſo that they are as much ours if ſo be we cleave faſt to them with a firm and lively faith, as if we our ſelves had done them....</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of all this I made it appear <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets to be contrary to the Doctrine of the Church, and upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I ſhall be ready to make enlargements not only out of all the ſame Springs and Authentick Records; but out of others too, which now for brevities ſake I do not mention, tho' they be conſiderable; however before I make an end of
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41737:111"/>this point, I muſt not omit taking notice of the Catechiſm of Predeſtination or ſome certain Queſtions and Anſwers about that matter in oppoſition to <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and as a preſervative againſt it when here it began to appear in the Year 1607, they were Licenſed by Authority, and Printed by <hi>Robert Barker,</hi> which then were bound up and ſold with the Bibles. I ſhall take notice only of three or four things in it, The anſwer to the queſtion, <hi>What is the reaſon why men do ſo much vary in matters of religion?</hi> Is this, <hi>Becauſe they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the Goſpel and Doctrine of Chriſt, which are ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto eternal life.</hi> And to the next queſtion, <hi>Are not all ordained to eternal life?</hi> The Anſwer is, <hi>Some are veſſels of wrath, ordained unto deſtruction, as others are veſſels of mercy prepared to glory.</hi> And to the queſtion, <hi>How ſtandeth it with God's juſtice that ſome are appointed to damnation?</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, <hi>Very well, becauſe all men have in themſelves ſin which deſerveth no leſs, and therefore the mercy of God is wonderful, in that he vouchſafed to ſave ſome of that ſinful race, and to bring them to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> And to the following queſtion, <hi>If God's ordinance and determination muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity take effect, then what need any man to care? For he that liveth well muſt needs be damned if he be thereunto ordained. And he that liveth ill, muſt needs be ſaved if he be thereunto appointed.</hi> The anſwer is this, <hi>Not ſo, for it is not poſſible that either the Elect ſhould always be without care to do well, or that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſhould have any will thereunto, for to have either good will, or good work is a teſtimony of the ſpirit of God, which is given to the Elect only; whereby faith is ſo wrought in them, that being grafted in Chriſt, they grow in holineſs, to that glory whereunto they are appointed,</hi> &amp;c. And as to another queſtion, <hi>Cannot ſuch periſh, as at ſome time or other feel theſe, ſpiritual motions within themſelves?</hi> 'Tis anſwered, <hi>It is not poſſible that they ſhould, for as Gods purpoſe is not changeable, ſo he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not of the gifts and graces of his adoption: neither doth he caſt off thoſe whom he hath once received.</hi> If we had had the penning of theſe words, we could not have ſet them down o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than they are.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41737:112"/>
               <p>Hence appeareth the ſweet and perfect harmony between theſe publick Records of the Faith and Religion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> let thoſe that have a mind to look farther there into among the 39 Articles, to peruſe the <hi>9th.</hi> about Original Sin, the <hi>11th.</hi> of the Juſtification of Man, and the <hi>18th.</hi> of obtaining eternal Salvation only by the name of Chriſt: With Mr. <hi>Roger</hi>'s Expoſition upon every one of them, ſpecially the <hi>17th.</hi> about Predeſtination.</p>
               <p>I hope we hitherto have out of Publick and Authentick Records, ſufficiently demonſtrated <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray to the Doctrine of the Church: We ought to take notice how theſe 39 Articles, Common-Prayer-Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were compiled before <hi>Arminius</hi> and his errors were heard of here, for I make no doubt but if they had been ſpread before, we ſhould have had other things more directly and poſitive againſt them: for certainly the ſpirit of the firſt Reformers was altogether for free-grace againſt free-will; wherefore to proſecute my Argument I now muſt ſhew how ſtrongly and generally <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> was oppoſed here when it firſt appeared: Which can more and more confirm it to be againſt the Doctrine of the Church. But this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth matter enough for another Chapter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> How Arminianiſm did meet with a ſtrong and general oppoſition here, when it began to appear.</head>
               <p>HEre the ſparkles of that unhappy Fire, did at firſt (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept once which I ſhall have occaſion to mention) break out in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where one Doctor <hi>Baroe</hi> a Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity Profeſſor, and one <hi>Barret</hi> in a Sermon of his, having publiſhed ſome <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets, a ſpeedy courſe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſuppreſs it; for the Vice-Chancellor and Heads of the Univerſity-Colleges met together, and declared thoſe opinions to be Innovations and contrary to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church profeſſed in that Univerſity. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent up Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> and <hi>Tindal,</hi> two Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their own, to Archbiſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> who forthwith called to him ſeveral learned and worthy Divines, amongſt whom were the then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the Elect Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> and others in and about the City, and upon due Examination and Debate upon the matter, on the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1595, drew up unanimouſly the 9 Articles, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, wherein they alſo had the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and of ſeveral Divines of that Province; which Articles are a ſentence paſt againſt <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> as the fit and proper remedy for the Diſeaſe; the Antidote was ſpecifical, and compoſed againſt the Poyſon, which becauſe they are few, ſhort and altogether to our purpoſe, I ſhall here ſet down in <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they were in Latin.</p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:41737:113"/>
               <p n="1">I. God from Eternity hath predeſtinated certain men unto life, certain men he hath reprobated to death.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The moving or ſufficient cauſe of predeſtination un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life, is not the fore-ſight of Faith, or of Perſeverance, or of Good works, or of any thing that is in the perſons predeſtinated; but only the good will and pleaſure of God.</p>
               <p n="3">III. There is a predetermined and certain number of the predeſtinate, which can never be augmented nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Thoſe who are not predeſtinated to Salvation, ſhall neceſſarily be damned for their ſins.</p>
               <p n="5">V. A true living and juſtifying Faith, and the ſpirit of God juſtifying, is not extinguiſhed, it falleth not away, or vaniſheth not away in the Elect, either finally or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A Man truly faithful; that is, ſuch a one, who is endued with a juſtifying Faith, is certain of the full aſſurance of Faith; of the remiſſion of his ſins, and of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Saving grace is not given, is not communicated, is not granted to all men, by which they may be ſaved, if they will.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. No Man can come unto Chriſt unleſs it ſhall be given him, and unleſs the Father ſhall draw him: And all Men are not drawn by the Father, that they may come to the Son.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. It is not in the will or power of any Man to be ſaved.</p>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:41737:113"/>
               <p>Theſe Articles upon ſerious debate and mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, having been agreed on by the perſons before nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very Eminent and Conſiderable Men, were afterwards ſent to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge</hi> by their Deputies, where they were received with the unanimous approbation of the whole Univerſity, with ſuch ſucceſs, that of the two Arminians, <hi>Baroe</hi> not long after left the Univerſity and went away, and <hi>Barret</hi> was forced ſolemnly to recant, which recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was Regiſtred. Thus a full ſtop was put to thoſe Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; and ſince that time till <hi>Laud</hi>'s Faction got the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hand, this and no other contrary Doctrine was taught there as being the true Orthodox according to Scriptures and the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s; but ſince that time, the Party have done what they could to ſuppreſs and diſcredit it. Yet though ſometimes truth be driven into corners, we doubt not but at laſt it will prevail notwithſtanding the oppoſition of Men and Devils, as it happened in the caſe of <hi>Arrianiſm.</hi> An Hereſie againſt the perſon of Chriſt, as <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> is againſt his grace: though to our great grief we ſee <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> revived in <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> as <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> is in <hi>Arminianiſm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we muſt go on in our deſign: In theſe 9 Articles we ſee the true Sence and Doctrine of the Church ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained by thoſe that by their office and learning are the fitteſt Interpreters thereof, ſo we may conclude that to be at that time the Doctrine of the Church which we have aſſerted. But we have farther proofs, which to bring in I muſt skip over ſome paſſages, but with an intent to make uſe of them in due place; the reaſon I have to do ſo, is becauſe what I am going upon, carries along with it the ſtamp of Publick Authority and Influence, I mean the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith and Articles of the general Convocation of <hi>Ireland</hi> held in <hi>Dublin</hi> 1605; That is 20 years after the Articles of <hi>Lambeth.</hi> By the grace of God I ſhall here ſet down thoſe Articles of that Convocation which are to our preſent purpoſe, and ſo ſhall begin with the Eleventh.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. God from all eternity did by his unchangaeble Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ordain whatſoever in time ſhould come to paſs, yet ſo as no violence is offered to the wills of the reaſonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:41737:114"/>and neither the liberty nor the contingency of the ſecond cauſes is taken away, but rather eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. By the ſame eternal Counſel, God hath predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome unto life, and reprobated ſome unto death, of both which there is a certain number known only to God, which can neither be increaſed nor diminiſhed.</p>
               <p n="13">XIII. Predeſtination unto life is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby before the Foundations of the World were laid, he hath conſtantly decreed in his ſecret Council, to deliver from Curſe and Condemnation, thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt out of mankind, and to bring them by Chriſt unto everlaſting Salvation as veſſels made to honour.</p>
               <p n="14">XIV. The cauſe moving God to predeſtinate unto life, is not the fore-ſeeing of Faith, or Perſeverance, or of good works, or of any thing which is in the perſon predeſtinated; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the good pleaſure of God himſelf, for all things being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the manifeſtation of his glory, and his glory being to appear both in the works of his Mercy and his Juſtice: It ſeemed good to his heavenly wiſdom, to chuſe out a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number, towards whom he would extend his undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mercy, leaving the reſt to be ſpectacles of his Juſtice.</p>
               <p n="15">XV. Such as are predeſtinated unto life he called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto God's purpoſe (his ſpirit working in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and through grace they obey the calling, they be juſtified freely, they be made Sons of God by adoption; they be made like the image of his only begotten Son Jeſus Chriſt; they walk religiouſly in good works, and at length by God's mercy they attain to everlaſting felicity: But ſuch as are not predeſtinated to Salvation, ſhall finally be condemned for their ſins.</p>
               <p n="25">XXV. The condition of Man after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is ſuch that he cannot turn and prepare himſelf by his own natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtrength and good works, to faith and calling upon God,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41737:114"/>wherefore we have no power to do good works pleaſant and acceptable unto God, without the grace of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting us, that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.</p>
               <p n="32">XXXII. None can come unto Chriſt unleſs it be given unto him, and unleſs the Father draw him, and all men are not ſo drawn by the Father, that they may come to the Son: Neither is there ſuch a ſufficient meaſure of grace vouchſafed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every Man, whereby he is enabled to come to everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life.</p>
               <p n="33">XXXIII. All God's Elect are in their time inſeparably united unto Chriſt, by the effectual and vital influence of the holy Ghoſt derived from him, as from the head unto every true member of his myſtical Body; and being thus made one with Chriſt, they are regenerated and made partakers of him and of all his benefits.</p>
               <p n="37">XXXVII. By juſtfying Faith we underſtand not only the common belief of the Articles of Chriſtian Religion, and a perſuaſion of the truth of God's word in general. But alſo a particular application of the promiſes of the Goſpel to the comfort of our own ſouls; whereby we lay hold on Chriſt with all his benefits, having an earneſt truſt and confidence in God, that he will be merciful to us for his Sons ſake; ſo that a true believer may be certain by the aſſurance of Faith, of the forgiveneſs of his ſins. and of his everlaſting Salvation by Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="38">XXXVIII. A true, lively, juſtifying Faith, and the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſpirit of God is not extinguiſhed, nor vaniſheth away in the regenerate, either totally or finally.</p>
               <p>The members that compoſed the Convocation which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed theſe Articles, were for the moſt part Engliſh Divines of great learning, who had made their ſtudies in our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, true members of the Church; ſo that 'tis the ſame as if they had been agreed here, and the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41737:115"/>were inſerted; withall we look upon the Church of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to be but one and the ſame. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and for Piety and Learning eminent <hi>James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Primate of that Kingdom, was preſent at the Convocation and had a hand in penning the Articles which were approved of by King <hi>James,</hi> Licenſed and publiſhed here by Authority. Our 39 Articles agreed upon in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. by the Convocation in 1552, ſeveral years before Arminianiſm was broached and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared abroad, could not be ſo plain and ſo full againſt it as are thoſe of <hi>Lambeth</hi> and of <hi>Dublin:</hi> For then the evil being broken out, a fit and proper remedy was applyed againſt it. Hence it is that in both we ſee thoſe Errors ſo clearly and fully condemned, that if we had been the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men thereof, we could not have drawn them otherwiſe than they are.</p>
               <p>I muſt now return to my more ancient proofs, but not generally publick as this laſt, the firſt that broke the Ice, as far as I have read, upon theſe matters was one <hi>Samuel Harſnet,</hi> who upon the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> 1584, having at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Croſs preached a Sermon concerning thoſe points, his Sermon was cenſured and condemned, and he at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his ſorrow for it. The ground of the complaint was that he had preached contrary to Truth and to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church. About this time ſomething having appeared abroad to favour thoſe Errors; amongſt others one <hi>Veron</hi> did well handle the points in a Book called <hi>A Fruitful Treatiſe of Predeſtination,</hi> with the Apology for the ſame, againſt thoſe who appeared in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and he Dedicated it to the Queen, and it was received with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and applauſe: But why ſhould I ſtand upon naming of perſons? Seeing all our firſt Reformers ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their judgment in the 39 Articles, the Common-Prayer-Book and Homilies, which they compiled: So we muſt name Biſhop <hi>Cranmer, Latimer, Hooper, Jewel, Ridley, Grindal,</hi> and <hi>Martyr, Bucer</hi> (who though Foreigners were Divinity Profeſſors, one at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the other at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and were made uſe of in the work of Reformation) <hi>Tyndal, Friths, Barnes,</hi> &amp;c. and ſince that time <hi>Edwin</hi> Archbiſhop of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:41737:115"/>
                  <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter</hi> in 1576, <hi>John Bridges,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxford, Babington</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the fore-named <hi>Whitgift</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Hutton</hi> of <hi>York.</hi> The Biſhops of <hi>London,</hi> of <hi>Bangor,</hi> Dr. <hi>Will. Whitaker,</hi> and ſince that time <hi>Perkins,</hi> not excepting Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> and who not? Which it were too long to number, we can bring a Liſt of 300 <hi>Engliſh, Scotch</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> yet moſt <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, with whom in the controverted points agreed all the Conſiderable and Eminent Inſtruments of Reformation as others beyond the Seas, <hi>Zuinglius, Luther, Calvin, Beza, Bullinger, Zanchius, Piſcator, Chamierus, Paraeus, Vrſinus, Junius, Molinaeus, Rivetus, Gomarus, Scultetus, Macovius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not go abroad, we have enough at home to carry on the argument, which I ſhall reduce within the time of King <hi>James</hi>'s Reign, and maybe go little after: Every one may know he was a learned Prince, and a true <hi>England</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, during his life the <hi>Arminian</hi> Sect durſt not appear here at leaſt publickly: For a Sermon in the year 1616 having been preached at <hi>Royſton</hi> before the King, concerning points of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> a recantation was impoſed upon Mr. <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who had preached it, and he recanted; and about ſix years after at <hi>Oxford,</hi> one Mr. <hi>Gabriel Bridges</hi> having in the Univerſity Church preached a Sermon againſt the abſolute Decree of Predeſtination, he was accuſed for preaching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Truth, and to the Articles of Religion eſtabliſhed in the Kingdom, and was ordered to maintain in the Schools the contrary of what he had preached in the Pulpit, which he did.</p>
               <p>Now we will come to a Royal Evidence, and that is King <hi>James</hi> in his own writings; at the conference at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> about predeſtination, he delared againſt the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> opinion, and was approved and applauded by all preſent: He ſaid how Predeſtination and Election depend not upon any qualities actions or works of Man, which are mutable, but upon God's Eternal and Immutable Decree and Purpoſe: And before we leave off, we ſhall by the grace of God ſhew his judgment about <hi>Arminius</hi> and his Errors. Firſt he calls <hi>Arminius a ſeditious and Heretical Preacher; an Enemy of God; the firſt in our age that infected</hi> Leyden <hi>with Hereſie, a man
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:41737:116"/>whom all the Reformed Churches of</hi> Germany <hi>had with open mouth complained of.</hi> An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n we ſhall ſee what he ſaith of his Followers. But let us ſee ſomething of what he writes againſt his and their opinions.</p>
               <p>As to Predeſtination he expreſſeth thus much:<note n="(a)" place="margin">Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord's <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>God hath two wills, a revealed will towards us, and that will is here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; he hath alſo a ſecret will in his eternal Counſel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all things are governed, and in the end, made over to turn to his glory: oftentimes drawing good effects out of bad cauſes, and light out of darkneſs, to the fullfilling either of his mercy or his juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The firſt Article of the Apoſtles Creed teacheth us that God is Almighty, however</hi> Vorſtius <hi>and the</hi> Arminians <hi>think to rob him of his eternal Decree and ſecret Will, making things to be done in this world whether he will or not.</hi> And in his Declaration againſt <hi>Worſtius,</hi> he ſaith,<note n="(b)" place="margin">Proteſtatio Antivorſtiana.</note> 
                  <hi>We do not doubt but that their Ambaſſadors,</hi> of Holland, <hi>which were with us about two years ſince, did inform them of a fore-warning, that we wiſhed the ſaid Ambaſſadors to make unto them in our name, to beware in time of Seditious and Heretical Preachers, and not to ſuffer any ſuch to creep into their State. Our principal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was of</hi> Arminius, <hi>who though himſelf were lately dead, yet had he left too many of his diſciples behind him,</hi> which he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth in what he addeth. <hi>We had well hoped, that the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup ſeed which that Enemy of God,</hi> Arminius, <hi>did ſow amongſt you ſome few years ſince, (whoſe diſciples and followers are yet too bold and frequent within your Dominions) had given you a ſufficient warning afterwards to take heed of ſuch infected perſons; ſeeing your own Countrymen already divided into facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon this occaſion, a matter ſo oppoſite to unity (which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the only prop and ſafety of your State next under God) as of neceſſity, it muſt by little and little bring you to utter ruin, if wiſely you do not provide againſt in; and that in time.</hi>

               <p>As to the point of <hi>free will</hi> and effectual grace, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth his mind thus: <hi>The only way for enabling us for to do it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Meditation on the Lord's Prayer.</note> (namely the will of God) <hi>is by our earneſt prayer to God, that he will enable us to do it, according to that of St.</hi> Auſtin <hi>da domine quod jubes, &amp; jube quod vis.</hi> And upon the petition againſt temptation, <hi>and lead us not into temptation, the</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians, <hi>cannot but miſtake the frame of this petition, for I

               <p>For <hi>certainty</hi> of ſalvation and <hi>perſeverance</hi> againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſy and falling away of true Believers, his mind he declareth thus.<note n="(b)" place="margin">Protest. Antivorſt.</note> 
                  <hi>About the ſame time one</hi> Bertius <hi>a Scholar of the late</hi> Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, (<hi>who was the firſt in our age that infected</hi> Leyden <hi>with Hereſie</hi>) <hi>was ſo impudent as to ſend a letter unto the Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>with a Book intituled</hi> de Apoſtaſia Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum; <hi>And not thinking it enough to own the ſending of ſuch a Book (the Tittle whereof only were enough to make it worthy to be burnt) he was moreover ſo ſhameleſs as to maintain in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Archbiſhop, that his Doctrine contained in his Book,</hi>

                  <hi>agreed with the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England. <hi>Let the Church of Chriſt then judge whether it was not high time for us to be ſtir our ſelves? when as this gangren had not only taken hold amongſt our near neighbours, ſo as</hi> non ſolum paries proximus jam ardebat; <hi>not only the next houſe was on fire, but it alſo did begin to creep into the bowels of our own Kingdom.</hi> O the care care of a Prince, Nurſing-father to the Church, never enough to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, would to God the like was now taken to oppoſe <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm</hi> as was then to prevent the coming in of <hi>Arminian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm.</hi> But that Prince goes on thus: <hi>It is true that it was our unhappineſs not to hear of this</hi> Arminius, <hi>before he was dead,

               <p>Hence it clearly appeareth how earneſt that Prince was to have <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> ſuppreſſed, and what opinion that wiſe and learned King who had ſtudied the points, had of their Errors which he calleth Hereſies and Schiſms, and them Hereticks and Atheiſtical Sectaries, ſpecially upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of <hi>Bertius</hi> his Book, the title whereof he ſaith makes it deſerves to be burnt; he calls it a blaſphemous book, and by his Ambaſſador ſaith to the <hi>States, not to ſuffer the followers of</hi> Arminius <hi>to make their actions an example for them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim to the world that wicked doctrine of the Apoſtaſie of Saints.</hi>

               <p>And as herein we ſee that King's opinion about <hi>Arminian</hi> Tenets, ſo by him we are informed how falſe it is to ſay that they agree with the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which after him, we may ſpeak to the <hi>Arminians,</hi> that to ſay <hi>Arminian</hi> Hereſies agree with the Doctrine of our Church is a groſs and impudent lye, and that King knew very well what is the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and a third thing we learn hence is, the dangers that ariſe from this kind of Doctrine, in three particulars. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Curſe of God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Infamy throughout all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A perpetual rent and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the whole body of the State, where it is tolerated, for <hi>Arminius</hi> left behind him a great diſtraction in the ſtate, out of which conſiderations we ſee that King took a good reſolution; when he ſaith, it was high time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtir our ſelves, when as this Gangrene had not only taken hold on our neareſt neighbours, but did alſo begin to creep into the Bowels of our own Kingdom. <hi>Arminian</hi> Opinions he compareth to a Gangrene, but he is not ſatisfied to take good Counſel himſelf, but he alſo gives it to the <hi>Hollanders;</hi> therefore for theſe reſpects, ſaith he, we have cauſe enough very heartily to requeſt you to root out with ſpeed theſe Hereſies and Schiſms which are beginning to bud forth amongſt you. We muſt not omit giving the King the due commendation he deſerveth for the pains he took to write againſt <hi>Worſtius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all this, let <hi>Arminians</hi> for ſhame leave off the Plea that their Errors are the Doctrine of our Church, which is as true and no more than when Papiſts do pretend their Religion to be the true Apoſtolical Faith, even in thoſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that are ſo contrary to it; but farther to ſhew how perſwaded King <hi>James</hi> was of the miſchief of thoſe unſound opinions, he was very active in ſuppreſſing them, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe evil conſequences that might happen thereby, and this not only at home but alſo abroad, upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he did write to the States general, and ordered his Ambaſſador there to be inſtant and to follow the buſineſs cloſe; and we may ſay, the meeting of the general Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> is in a high degree, due to the King's earneſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations:

               <p>So then during K. <hi>James</hi>'s time <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> had nothing to do here, and continued ſo in <hi>Charles</hi> Reign, till <hi>Laud</hi> came into favour and was made Archbiſhop, and yet at firſt thoſe Errors were ill lookt upon, for Mr. <hi>Richard Mountague</hi> in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> having written for <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> his Book was anſwered by five or ſix of the moſt conſiderable men in the Nation, all agreeing he had departed from the Doctrine of the Church; he was thrice about it before the Parliament, and his Book condemned as contrary to the Articles of the Church. Under his Hand and Seal he renounced his Errors in a letter of his written to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he thought he ſtood in need of a Pardon, which King <hi>Charles</hi> gave him for all his writings, and at laſt called in his Book as the great occaſion of many unneceſſary troubles. After him, Dr. <hi>Thomas Jackſon</hi> came upon the Stage, but for thoſe <hi>Arminian</hi> Books of his, was cenſured in Parliament, and excepted againſt by the Convocation and in the following
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41737:118"/>Parliaments, Complaints even by ſome of the beſt Sons of the Church were made againſt thoſe Innovations and Errors in Doctrine, under the name and notion of <hi>Arminianiſm:</hi> Yet under the favour of Biſhop <hi>Laud</hi> and his Faction being encouraged with Protection and Preferments, got much ground and corrupted many members of the Clergy, who became rotten branches of a ſound and wholeſome tree, yet for all the violent ſtream, ſome had the courage and zeal to appear in writing againſt it, though they ſmarted for it, they charged <hi>Arminians</hi> of being favourers and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of Popery; of renouncing the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of being peſtilent Hereticks, Enemies of God and of his grace, for the moſt part licentious, proud, vicious and bitter Enemies to the practical power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whereof ſome turned Papiſts, Innovators, and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Peace of both Church and State: And any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader that will take the pains to read ſome of thoſe Books may find the charge well proved.</p>
               <p>Indeed the ſerious conſideration of theſe things, doth afford matter for ſad thoughts, and ſufficient cauſe of grief to thoſe who love the glory of God, and the good of his Church, after ſo much pains taken by the firſt inſtruments of our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to remove abuſes in Doctrine, and bring things into the true Primitive Channel, who left us Articles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Works in writing, according to the true Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Doctrine contained in the word of God, believed and profeſſed by the Orthodox Primitive Church, which theſe firſt Reformers ſealed with their own Blood; for they were <hi>Martyrs</hi> not only for refuſing to joyn with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in her Idolatry, but alſo for the teſtimony of the grace of God in Chriſt to exclude all humane help, power, ſtrength, abilities from working our Salvation by means of any diſpoſitions, free-will, improvement of graces and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of our own; theſe things they laid down their lives for, and to maintain that our whole Salvation comes from the free grace of God alone, and from nothing at all of our own.

But let them do their worſt, the Truth and meaning of thoſe Rules of our Faith is ſtill the ſame; but they are bad Children of a good Mother, from whoſe Counſels and Directions they are degenerated, and about things in Queſtion apoſtatized: So that in this reſpect they have cruelly divided, rent, and torn Mother-Church; which, if we ſhould look only into that rotten part of it, we might well ſay of it, with the Prophet,<note n="(i)" place="margin">Iſa. 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>How is the faithful City become an Harlot?</hi> and apply to it what is ſpoken of the Church of <hi>Sardis, I know thy works, that thou haſt a name, that thou liveſt, and art dead: be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die.</hi> Thou haſt the name of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but thou art not, as to that thou art dead, thou art ſuch only in a Shew: Soundneſs in Matters of Grace is one of the Vitals of true Religion, and of a true Church: There are ſome things remaining in thee, thou art not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>Pelagian,</hi> thou art not a thorough-paced <hi>Papiſt,</hi> thou minceſt the Matter, and owneſt ſomething of Grace; but have a care,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.1, 2.</note> for thoſe things are ready to die, if they be not ſtrengthned.</p>
               <p>Though the Corruption in theſe points of Grace be very Epidemical, and too far ſpread amongſt thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be the Sons of the Church: Yet Thanks be to God, all are not infected; all along there have been, and ſtill are, ſome who receive the Mother's Counſel, and follow her Directions, in the ſame ſenſe and meaning thereof, and continue obedient Children, which others do not: For by what I already ſaid, it doth appear, how <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> far from being the Doctrine of the Church, as conſtituted in the beginning of Reformation, and long after, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, and condemned by it. One thing more I ſhall
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:41737:119"/>add, to ſhew, as I ſaid but juſt now, that for all the great and general Corruption crept amongſt the Members in thoſe and late Days. There are, and have been, ſome eminent Members of the Church not aſhamed of the Truth, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to own it: And for the truth of this I appeal to the Author <hi>Anonymus,</hi> and nameleſs, of the Book called, <hi>Several Conferences between a Romiſh Prieſt, a Fanatick Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and a Divine of the Church of England.</hi> His Evidence muſt be the more received, that he is no favourer of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, but declares himſelf an Enemy to them, and to <hi>Puritans,</hi> in that he moſt undecently traduces the Chaplain for a Fool, and doth ridicule him to ſuch a height, as if he wanted common Senſe and Reaſon, and could ſpeak no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Nonſence for himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Very wonderful Proofs; as though many of our Church againſt the Puritan Party, had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Calviniſm in the point of Predeſtination, ſpecially in that moderate way wherein</hi> R. Abbot <hi>aſſerted it; as though it were not poſſible for Men to be zealous for our Liturgy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, if they held the Doctrine of Election and Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. But we do not want thoſe of the higheſt Order in our Church at this day, who are eminent for Learning and Piety, and Zeal for the Church, who would take it very ill from</hi> T. G. <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of thoſe Opinions, to be thought Enemies of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as the Puritans were.</hi> So that although that Truth of late Years was much oppoſed and abuſed, God never left it without Witneſſes. Here, beſides the eminent Doctors and Prelates we named before. Amongſt thoſe that have ſuccesfully taken great pains in <hi>Latin</hi> to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this Truth, we muſt reckon Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and Dr. <hi>Twyſſe,</hi> and beyond Sea <hi>Peter Molienaus,</hi> in his <hi>Anatome Arminia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſmi, Wedelius's Arcana Arminianiſmi,</hi> with the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Dort,</hi> &amp;c. All which, as to matter of Fact, as of right, do give impartial and reaſonable Readers, a full ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, ſeeing Matters of Grace are Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to our Salvation, we are highly concerned to mind them. Let this Queſtion be put to any, or to every Man, Would you go into Heaven, or into Hell? I think there is
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41737:120"/>none ſo deſperately wicked, but that if the thing depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Wiſh, without wavering he would anſwer, Into Heaven. Then, if he hath the leaſt ſparkle of Reaſon, he muſt grant, he cannot go without a Way, and a Guide to lead him thorough; for the Way is thorny, and full of Difficulties. In the choice of a Guide let him come to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> chuſe either God or Man: Surely he may eaſily determine, I had rather to truſt to God than to Man. About Means and Ways the <hi>Arminian</hi> ſaith, if you have a mind, you can go to Heaven; you have within you a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Grace and Light to carry you thither; you have a free Will, you can go if you pleaſe; for you can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, believe, make a good uſe of Means, and perſevere if you will. But on the other ſide, let us hear what God ſaith: Thou canſt not ſee, for thou art blind; thou canſt not hear, for thou art deaf; thou canſt not ſpeak, for thou art dumb; thou canſt not walk, for thou art impotent and lame; thou canſt not move, becauſe thou art dead. In proſecuting of this Argument, I ſhall not do as <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> who frame in their Heads ſome pretty and pleaſant Notions, and deliver them in as plauſible a manner as they can, and take us to be ſo credulous as to take their bare Word for it, without any Scripture Proofs.

               <p>To conclude theſe Evidences; it muſt be granted how without faith and repentance we cannot be ſaved, but with them we ſhall ſurely be: For the ſubſtance and declaration of the Goſpel is <hi>repent and believe.</hi> Now 'tis eaſie out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to ſhew how both repentance and ſaith do not depend upon the will and power of man, but they are the gift of God.

But ſelf-denyal is a hard thing to be obtained, and ſelf-love ſo deeply rooted in man's corrupt heart, that they will not part with boaſtings, they are pleaſed with the thoughts of their own worthineſs, and are fond of an imaginary power and abilities which they fanſie to be in themſelves, inſtead of giving God the glory. <hi>Yet, O Lord, to thee belong honour and righteouſneſs,</hi>
